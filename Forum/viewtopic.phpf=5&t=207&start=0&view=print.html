				<div class="content">Dear Moai,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I have been developing with your SDK for a few weeks, starting with Beta 0.7.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Now that it is at Beta 0.9, is version 1.0 next?  Is 1.0 a Release Candidate?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I ask about 1.0 because of the following:
<br />
<br />1) I am currently under the assumption that at 1.0, the fees for Moai cloud will be released .. ?
<br />
<br />2) We want our App to work on Kindle Fire, and are unclear on the stability of Moai on the Android and esp. the Kindle Fire .. ?
<br />
<br />3) As much as we would love to use Flash to create key assets, we have avoided it under the suspicion we did not know how well supported Flash is, and were not in a position to test all features to determine if we could use it (ex. ActionScript 2.0 vs. 3.0, etc., etc.).  Is there a collection of Moai Flash links, and/or is Flash development with Moai recommended, i.e. is it expected to work well for 1.0?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thank you very much.  I have not expressed massive praise for the SDK in the Forums because I still have not shipped, nor have experienced integration of Game Center.  The fact we use it everyday to make 2 online apps, should say it all.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Bonozo
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks for the post. Yes, the 1.0 release of the SDK and Cloud is expected soon, with pricing for Moai Cloud. Drop me an email at todd at ziplinegames.com if you want more info.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />We have a Kindle Fire and we are working on supporting it in Android. More news to come on that soon as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The Zipline studio has three artists using Flash (latest version) every day to export flip books and sprite sheets into Moai using the JSFL scripts provided with Moai, so that should be a safe bet for 1.0. I've started a page on that at <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/wiki/Tools_that_work_with_Moai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">/wiki/Tools_....._with_Moai</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />GameCenter integration is done. We need to add some docs on that.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />
<br />Todd</div>

				<div class="content">Dear moai team,<br /><br />Is there any ballpark/guess figures you can gave us for the cloud pricing?<br />I don't want to have to re-write everything to phyton(for gae) or php, after moai goes 1.0 and the price will cost me an arm and a leg.<br /><br />If the price is around industry standard, I would love to support you guys <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
