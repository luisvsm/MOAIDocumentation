				<div class="content">I needed to test a new graphical designer and since everybody is doing flappy bird clones these days, I decided why not. The whole project was done in just a few days.<br /><br />It uses heavily modified MOAI 1.2 (Build 56), multiple advertising networks with an ad rotator (Chartboost, Playhaven, AdMob, Heyzap, StartApp and RevMob) and multiple leaderboard solutions (Google Play Game Services, Amazon Game Circle and the usual iOS Game Center). I may write a blog post of the modifications I did and why I decided to downgrade to 1.2 at some point.<br /><br />Google Play -&gt; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.postmorph.raccoon" class="postlink">link</a><br />Amazon -&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmorph-Ltd-Razy-Raccoon/dp/B00IUMDWLY/ref=sr_1_2?s=mobile-apps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395149950&amp;sr=1-2" class="postlink">link</a><br />iOS -&gt; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/razy-raccoon/id700008460?ls=1&amp;mt=8" class="postlink">link</a><br /><br />Protip: disable wifi and data network if you don't want to see ads <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">Nice! Our flappy bird clone should be live tomorrow as well.<br /><br />Took 5 days from start to finish. However, we did add a twist to the flappy bird game play. I'll reveal all when it's live  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">@scottwb:<br />I suppose downloads won't be too good because I decided not to go with &quot;flappy&quot; in the title. I was also thinking for different ways to make the game more interesting but it was an initial task for a designer so decided to finish it quick and just release it with the basic functionality. As for promotion I'm doing some in-house advertising on Mahjong Skies and paid for a couple hundred installs on App Brain. I'll probably won't ask Amazon to be featured this time as there are thousands of flappy clones that are doing it right now. Maybe wait a few months and then try it.<br /><br />As for ads... I show them using if math.random(1,3) == 3 then Ads:show() end so I guess you got lucky <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />@JDance, @Motig, Okay, I'll see what can I do about writing a blog post about my recent experience with Moai <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">@btatarov, not sure how ours will fly  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> as we didn't go with anything 'flappy' either.<br /><br />I'm currently:<br /><br />- cross promoting<br />- facebook micro campaign<br /><br />Have to say that the facebbok response has been the best ever for any of our apps so far.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

				<div class="content">@scottwb:<br />AppBrain is pretty cheap, you can bid only $0.2 per install and you don't need to put anything extra in your code to make it work. I do a mixture of campaigns where I bid $0.4 for users from USA, $0.3-0.35 for the rest of the Tier 1 countries like UK, Germany, Japan, etc. and $0.2 South America, China, India and some of the European Tier 3 countries. It's going pretty well so far, I get 500-600 installs per day <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">@btatarov, am running the AppBrain campaign but can't seem to get any UK or US installs. Plenty of installs for other parts of the world. My CPI bid is $0.30 and is averaging about $0.28.<br /><br />Any tips?</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>btatarov</strong></div>
				<div class="content">@scottwb, I think 0.30 is too little for US and UK. I leave most of the world at $0.20, UK at $0.35 and US ad $0.40 but I think if you want to target mainly these countries then you need to at least do $0.40 for UK and $0.45 for US and leave the rest out. The counties that deliver most clicks for $0.20 in my situation are Brasil, Turkey, Colombia, India, Ukraine, India, Philippines and Thailand. It's up to you if you need these. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />P.S. Can you tell me how you set your Facebook ad campaigns? I once tried that but was receiving something like $0.18-0.20 CPC which is much much higher than $0.30-40 CPI from App Brain for US. I stopped the campaign after $60.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks @btatarov, I'll try those numbers.<br /><br />About Facebook ... I go with sponsored stories linked to our Facebook page:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/meyumeapps" class="postlink">https://www.facebook.com/meyumeapps</a><br /><br />I then track the clicks through bitly, no guarantee that they lead to installs but the response for clicks on Mind the Gaps has been about 10x the norm.<br /><br />E.g. $20 has got me 407 link clicks to the app and 24 page likes. Best I've ever got.</div>
