				<div class="content">It's been a long road, but our first title with Moai (and our second title, and first completely internally developed) has finally launched on Steam! <br /><br />You can see it here: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/262770/" class="postlink">http://store.steampowered.com/app/262770/</a>. I know halfnelson helped beta test it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Now, as it's 4:40 am here, i'm going to sleep <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">I give it 5 stars. Really good. Graphics even at full HD look sharp and clean. Gameplay is fluid and not glitchy. Backstory is told very ingeniously. The downwards platforming thing is a good twist on platformers that gives you more flexibility than just hold right and press jump like sidescrollers. The art and animations are so smooth. I am going to yoink your desktop hosts for sure!. What technologies did you use (untz?, spine?, spriter?, fmod?).<br /><br />Thanks for the chance to beta test it too.</div>

				<div class="content">Untz (which we will likely be making mods to, or replacing with something based on PortAudio for the forthcoming Linux release) <br /><br />We added a bunch of features to moai, most of which are detailed <a href="best-way-to-submit-large-ish-feature-patches-t2414/index.html" class="postlink">here</a><br /><br />The designer used texture packer and GLEED (I don't think physicseditor was used - will update this after I speak with our gameplay programmer)<br /><br />We're looking at spriter and spine for the next game, but we've got a lot of technical debt to pay off (hence me making noises about merging upstream and getting some sanity back into moai-dev <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) before we start the next Moai project. And yes - assuming the game sells, there will be another Moai project <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">The game's great! Works like a charm and is fun to play. Xbox 360 controller support is flawless.<br /><br />So far I found only 2 minor issues:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>When starting the game, just after it switches to fullscreen, there is a white unaligned rectangle on black background for one second.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Steam achievements</span>: Accordingly to the Steam desktop client, I have unlocked some number of achievements and I can see the last one unlocked. But when I display all my FF's achievements, none are unlocked. When checking my Steam profile through web browser, I can see there are no unlocked achievements. During the gameplay, I didn't notice any achievement being unlocked.</li></ol>BTW: What about the Freedom Fall Opening Animation? <a href="http://risachantag.deviantart.com/art/Freedom-Fall-Opening-Animation-410581512" class="postlink">http://risachantag.deviantart.com/art/Freedom-Fall-Opening-Animation-410581512</a> (made by creator of the game). Would you add it to the Steam release? It's amazing and really helps setting the mood of the game. <br /><br />TIP for players: If you experience v-sync problems (screen tearing), try disconnecting your secondary monitor.<br /><br />Wish you all the best with your game!</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>halfnelson wrote:</cite>Any reason for using portaudio instead of sdl2 on linux?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'm going to try SDL2's audio first because we are linked against it. Unitz is kind-of it's own library, so if i'm going to replace how it works or replicate it - i'd rather use a smaller dependency? <br /><br />I'll probably do some small latency tests via SDL and Portaudio, and maybe not bother with PA if the latency is close to the same...</div>

				<div class="content">Congrats on your game and I look forward to Linux release!<br /><br />Hopefully you will be releasing for Android/iPad tablets?  Your biggest sales should come from there as younger audiences prefer not to play on desktops anymore.  Your game looks touch-friendly and since you are on MOAI it only makes sense to port to supported platforms.</div>

				<div class="content">Congratulations on the release - just purchased it and I'm impressed - its a great-looking platformer!  Very nice to know that MOAI is under the hood - inspiring, in fact!  I love the parallex effects on layers, its a subtle but well-tweaked effect, and I look forward to playing this game more ..</div>

It's a really great platformer with smooth motion and impressive character.<br />It reminds me of Saira ( I loved it too ).<br />Congratulations!<br /><br />PS: somebody please add this game into &quot;Games made by MOAI&quot; page !</div>
