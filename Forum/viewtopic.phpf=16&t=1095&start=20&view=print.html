				<div class="content">Hey guys,<br /><br />I'm now running a<span style="font-weight: bold"> HUGE discount on all libraries up to 75% off for a limited time!</span> Don't let the low prices of these cues fool you. These are professional libraries made for high-quality games. <br /><br />If you have a game that's fantasy based, RPG, or medieval, you'll definitely want to check out the Kingdom of Light libraries if you're in need of rich orchestral music. This music is for those who demand excellent music but cannot afford the $200-$300 per minute of custom music. Reminiscent of Middle-Earth and other epic fantasy films, the Premium Edition has over 3 hours of cues. This is not just a mixture of songs, but this library was in the making for 5 months to be a cohesive aural experience on a grand scale. From the peaceful settings of a hovel town (starter zones), exploration of majestic mountains, deep into caverns and dungeons, royal cities, mystical  landscapes, epic battle sequences to tavern music and more, the Kingdom of Light libraries is sure to bring your game to a pro-audio level at an ultra-affordable price! <br /><br />Please check out the reviews or simple listen for yourself.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I'm also available for hire for your next project</span>! Whether it's a subtle piano cue or full orchestra score,  I have a wide selection of styles I can produce at various budgets. If you're curious of what I can produce for your game, check out my site for the wide range of styles. Hit me up through my website for questions and pricing!<br /><br />Thanks for your time and for checking out the reviews. Enjoy the music!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /> <br />Peter G.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">http://www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="http://BonixMusic.com/files/111553/kol-header2thin.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

Initially the KAOS ELEMENTS libraries were set out to be bargain libraries at the quality that reflects the price. While doing the KE libraries I found myself spending much more time orchestrating and mixing then originally planned. However, instead of increasing the price to reflect the quality, I decided to keep these at ultra-low prices to help indie studios &amp; indie devs just starting out. Hope you enjoy them!<br />(My personal favorite from the KE-Mystical Dreams library is 'A Hero's Dream').<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kingdom of Light</span>, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bonixmusic.com/kingdom-of-light">http://bonixmusic.com/kingdom-of-light</a><!-- m --><br />Lastly, for those creating epic-fantasy adventure games, be sure to check out the Kingdom of Light Editions (33% off – limited time!). It's an all-in-one music library solution for moderately small land masses to enormous land masses..think EPIC SIZE. (over 3 hours of cues – tavern music, travel, themes, mystical, large battles, skirmishes, dungeons, etc.) All music was compose and orchestrated by me over the course of approximately 4 months, to be cohesive, same harmonic structures and instrumentation (orchestra) throughout. This sounds closer to a 'movie score' as my approach was very similar to scoring to a feature film.<br /><br />Here's one <span style="font-weight: bold">review</span>, ”The music provided in this package is of an entirely professional standard and would not sound out of place in any top-budget or AAA title. For this reason, the package's price is potentially one of the best I've seen anywhere. This is an absolute must-have for any developers looking to improve the quality of their work ten-fold through the use of this music.&quot;  T.
