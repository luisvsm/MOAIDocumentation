				<div class="content">I'd really rather continue working on adding Camera support this week, so please .. have at it!<br /><br />You can see my work here, in case you haven't already:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/seclorum/moai-dev">https://github.com/seclorum/moai-dev</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Specifically, I modified the Android template sources to include the relevant keyboard handling code, and as well added a TextView in the Android layout which sits outside the view of the main window - this is key (pun intended) because it is the TextView that gets the IME event messages and passes them through to the Lua VM side of things .. you should pay close attention to the way that this view is instantiated and set to be outside the main view, with Margin settings.<br /><br />With regards to my code, there were some changes in the Android host done by Zipline after I had already finished this work, specifically with regards to locking - so you can't just copy/paste my code from the Android host, alas - but it should be enough to give you a full idea of what it takes to make it work.  Also I suggest that you should use the moaigui framework for testing, as this is the best way to see whats going on so far .. at least, its what I used while adding MOAIKeyboardAndroid support.<br /><br />Then, on the flipside, there is the MOAIKeyboardAndroid.cpp/.h code, which by now should be very familiar to you - this is something you probably can just copy from my fork.<br /><br />Anyway, looking forward to the next MOAI release!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  If you need help or want some testing, just say the word ..</div>

				<div class="content">So, I got pulled away from this for a bit but finally got back to it yesterday.<br /><br />I pushed a first pass here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/tree/feature/android_keyboard">https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/tree/f ... d_keyboard</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />It functions the same way as ibisum's implementation as far as I can tell, however I'd like to clean it up a bit more and add some more functions to more closely match the iOS version before I push this to master. Any input is welcome.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi. Very cool that this is getting merged in. Any idea when a new SDK build will be out? I guess there is more people than me wanting this, and I feel more comfortable working with that than building moai-dev myself and being cutting edge <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">More updates on github, Fixed some more bugs and added some improvements. We're still testing them right now, so grabbing it is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />If anyone has input on expected behavior when the keyboard partially covers the screen ( instead of full screen ) I'd love to hear it. Right now I have a EditText pop down from the top so the users can see what they're typing.<br /><br />It'll be shipping ready in a couple weeks.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think I like the idea of having the EditText pop down happen .. if you're using MOAIKEyboardAndroid with moaigui, for example, this interferes with the design layout quite significantly.  Maybe having it attached to the top of the Keyboard view would be cleaner?</div>
