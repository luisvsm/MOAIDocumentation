<title type="html"><![CDATA[Frames and meshes and vertex buffers, oh my...]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1616&amp;p=8820#p8820"><![CDATA[
So, I have a large mesh that wants to be updated &quot;every frame&quot;.<br /><br />Thing is, if I put the update in a MOAICoroutine, I will at least sometimes generate my entire 1200-vertex mesh twice in a single frame. That's wasteful.<br /><br />The only distinction I've found so far is that a MOAIScriptDeck's draw callback appears to only run during an actual render. So, in theory, I could have my regular stuff do a mesh update, then set a flag, then not do another mesh update until the flag is cleared -- and have a script deck clear the flag.<br /><br />But that can't possibly be the intent.<br /><br />So in general: If I have a task which is by definition worthless to do twice during a single rendering frame, where do I put it? Do I just put it in the code for a ScriptDeck? I found a blog post claiming you could get callbacks from &quot;RenderMgr and friends&quot;, but I couldn't find anything, except maybe the grabNextFrame, which sounds... excessive.<br /><br />What I'm hoping to do is find ways that I could reduce the amount of time I spend rendering giant vertex buffers that aren't ever going to be displayed, because I'll be replacing them before openGL ever sees them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1298">seebs</a> â€” Mon Feb 04, 2013 3:23 pm</p><hr />
