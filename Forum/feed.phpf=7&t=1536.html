<title type="html"><![CDATA[Animation with Rapanui - need help making transitions smooth]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1536&amp;p=8368#p8368"><![CDATA[
I have a 2d platformer (non-tilebased levels) I'm currently using a spritesheet and Rapanui's createAnim functionality (and newSequence for each anim of course) for the animations in.<br /><br />The problem I'm having is that the examples in Rapanui's samples for animation only demonstrate stopping/transitioning from the onEnd callback. Right now I have it set up so that, for instance, if you jumped, it will play the jump anim with 1 repeat (i.e., plays once), and on stop it checks to see if you're still in the air, and then plays it again.<br /><br />The issue with this is that there is a noticeable pause between the time the anim stops and before it plays again from the onEnd callback.<br /><br />Is there any way to more reliably play/stop the anims based on user input? Having these hitches in all my animations sucks. Any help is much appreciated.<br /><br />As an aside: I of course could just not use Rapanui's animation, but it's so much easier and less work than doing it all manually, so I'd prefer to stick with it if possible unless there's no way to mitigate the pause between repeating the anim.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1241">ankharlyn</a> â€” Tue Jan 08, 2013 1:10 am</p><hr />
