				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />do you want to start playing around with Moai but cannot find it anywhere? Or you got it but it doesn't work? Well there's a link to a package which will sure help you to get things started:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Moai-Lightweight</span> - Download Moai Last Stable Release + Samples - <span style="font-style: italic">Version 1.4p0</span>:<br /><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!SE8x0CxK!Bu-KnVh3St7TtsuHKSJbCi-AI3ELEShwyfIcm3-BFKM" class="postlink">https://mega.co.nz/#!SE8x0CxK!Bu-KnVh3St7TtsuHKSJbCi-AI3ELEShwyfIcm3-BFKM</a><br /><br />Lightweight means that there are no source codes, but you'll of course get a fully fledged version of Moai. To download sources, check Moai GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/moai/moai-dev" class="postlink">https://github.com/moai/moai-dev</a> or download their last stable version using this link: <a href="https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/archive/Version-1.4p0.zip" class="postlink">https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/archive/Version-1.4p0.zip</a><br /><br />In the Moai-Lightweight package, look into <span style="text-decoration: underline">samples/Getting samples to run on Windows.txt</span> file. It will show you how to get Moai working on your machine (it's easy).<br /><br />All samples were tested on Windows 8.1, but I hope they will work on Windows 7 too. Samples which didn't work properly were placed into <span style="text-decoration: underline">samples/win_incompatible_or_broken</span> folder. Anyway, check out their .lua sources too, there's plenty of knowledge to learn from them.<br /><br />BTW: OS X - Last stable Moai host is there also.<br /><br />Welcome to Moai!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks a lot, dorotik! This saved me a lot of time <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'd suggest the web admins to change their download links (which don't work since Moai Cloud is closed) to something like this. I know Moai is &quot;for people who don't mind to get their hands dirty&quot;, but having the latest binaries (not only osx and windows) in a zip uploaded to any download service is not very difficult. <br /><br />When I first tried to download Moai from this website and saw the official links didn't work, I thought Moai was dead, but then I thought &quot;It doesn't make much sense. Broken age has just been released&quot;.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Is someone thinking of releasing the MOAI 1.5 host's binaries? <br /><br />Everything compiles without problems in my machine, but having a pre-built package allows for a &quot;pick up and play&quot; experience (without having to install a ton of stuff).<br /><br />At least the Windows, Mac and Linux hosts would be great. The HTML/JS would also be great for prototyping and sharing stuff quickly.<br /><br />If no one is up for it, is there any complications in making something like this? Can my compiled binaries run in other machines?</div>
