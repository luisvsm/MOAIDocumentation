				<div class="content">Did you use the make-host.bat script to make a new Android project for your sources, using the Template?  &quot;MyDomain&quot; and &quot;MyApp&quot; look like the wrong names for these paths .. they would better be something like &quot;src/com/SH_Black_Hole/some_app_name/MoaiActivityJava&quot; .. where &quot;some_app_name&quot; is of course a proper name.<br /><br />In general, you must use 'make-host' for every Android project target.  This script file creates, from a non-working Template (*), a new Android project, initially in a folder named &quot;untitled-host/&quot;, although this can be changed.  The sources in that folder are *then* usable to build the MOAI Executable for Android, bundle it with some Lua sources, and execute as a MOAI App - it is a project directory which can both be imported into Eclipse, *OR* built from the command line.  Ideally, you wouldn't need to mod much Android stuff in this project folder, and use it simply as a host for MOAI, but you can if needed, modify the onboard Android OS host code, as well.  Ideally, not: you're just using it to build your MOAI executable for Android, and not much more than that.<br /><br />This Android project, named and path'ed as you specify in the &quot;make-host.bat&quot; argument list, also at some point needs to point to your MOAI Sources for the project you are building, because it is a real Android project to build the moai executable and then package it up into a working .apk for distribution on Android, doing absolutely nothing if not given a main.lua file for execution, as well as all your images and whatnot that compose the basis of your MOAI Application.  <br /><br />Please note that the bundling of your sources into the Android APK can go wrong, even if everything else is okay, meaning that you can build an Android project successfully, yet still get nothing on-screen, simply because your Lua sources are missing/not-working.<br /><br />So, there are few bits that need connecting.  In your case, &quot;MyDomain&quot; and &quot;MyApp&quot; don't seem right.<br /><br />So, for me every time I want to start an Android build for a MOAI project, it goes a bit like this (on Linux):<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="viewtopic.php%3Ff=9&amp;t=483&amp;start=60&amp;view=print.html#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code style="line-height: 30%;"><ol class="" style="font-family:monospace;"><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">~/moai/moai-dev/ant/ $ #My project name is 'fot' ..</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">~/moai/moai-dev/ant/ $ ./make-host.sh -a all -p at.w1xer.droids.fot</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /></ol></code></dd></dl><br /><br />(This will produce an &quot;untitled-host/&quot; folder .. I then rename untitled-host/ to &quot;fot-android-host/&quot;, move it to my buildserver, and edit the local configuration files (settings-global.sh/settings-local.sh), before then doing:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="viewtopic.php%3Ff=9&amp;t=483&amp;start=60&amp;view=print.html#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code style="line-height: 30%;"><ol class="" style="font-family:monospace;"><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">~/moai/build-android/fot-android-host/ $ ./run-host.sh</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /></ol></code></dd></dl><br /><br />.. to test THE BUILD FIRST.  <br /><br />If I get a spinning MOAI logo, I'm all good, because the Template is set up to run a demo. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  So I then edit &quot;moai-target&quot;, point it at my project code sources instead, and re-build .. making sïœ«ure of course to be watching logs with 'adb log' and so on, along the way.<br /><br />If you can do something similar with the Cygwin+Windows side of things, sure it will work.  I guess you just have to get through the 'unix-isms' of the MOAI build setup as it currently stands (I think most MOAI core devs are MacOSX/Linux guys, with a few Windows bravehearts sort of straggling along.. it really is very easy to do cross-platform dev with MOAI, as long as you're using either an OSX or Linux host somewhere in your development chain ..<br /><br />(*EDIT _ Re: Template is non-working - yes, the sources in $MOAI_HOME/ant/host-source *do not work*.  If you find yourself trying to do anything with those files, in Eclipse, or whatever, struggling to get an Android project working, forget it.  You *HAVE* to use make-host.sh/make-host.bat to generate a new project, from the Template sources in this folder.  If you monkey with $MOAI_HOME/ant/host-source, the only possible reason to do so, is to make modifications to the Template for all future invocation of the &quot;Lets Start This Project On Android&quot; #1 script&#058; make-host.[sh,bat])<br /><br />EDIT2: &quot;what is &quot;../../include/lua-modules&quot;&quot; .. this is a remnant from earlier invocations of sample code, I believe .. &quot;lua-modules&quot; isn't strictly part of MOAI, its just a place for lua addons .. I for example, have lua-enumerable.lua in my modules list, and anyone can hard-code other paths at the end of this if they also have external Lua dependencies .. thus I believe that this is 'left in' as a hint that one need not only have a single path to sources in the config ..)</div>

It is not a part of the process, as if Cygwin is installed correctly, it should take care of all of this for you.<br /><br />You have run make-host.sh and passed it a project name in Java form right?  Something like:<br /><br />cd /cygdrive/c/moai/ant/<br />./make-host.sh   -p yourappname.yourdomainname.com<br /><br /><br />Leave the terminal open. After this, confirm that under the ant directory, a folder named untitled-host has been created.  ( ls untitled-host      If that returns cannot access untitled-host, it wasnt created ).<br /><br />Assuming it does exist<br /><br />At this point you need to change in to the untitled-host folder as described in the guide and edit settings-local.sh.  You can use notepad, or whatever to edit the values.  Do so and save.  Now back at the terminal window<br /><br />cd untitled-host<br />./run-host.sh<br /><br />If this fails, paste the exact results from the terminal window here.<br /><br /><br /><br />Android development works just fine on Windows, *once you've got the environment configured*.  This is the tricky part, but frankly, you've gotta go through this if you are going to work with any of Googles ( shoddy, imho ) developer tools, so might as well get it over with.</div>

Select your the cygwin folder, etc. Enter the cpio in the search field and click on skip(see screenshot)<br /><br /><a href="http://img440.imageshack.us/i/67403864.png/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/5637/67403864.th.png" alt="Image" /></a></div>

				<div class="content">I finally have successfully built from source, imported into eclipse and building error free, but the hello-moai sample is showing up rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Furthermore it is scaled down as if trying to fill in as if the 3:2 ratio of  480 x 320 as 320 as the 3 for height and like 108 as the width. It always opens this way. I am using a Galaxy SII. There are also no errors in the terminal.<br /><br />Is there a step I missed? What should I do?</div>

				<div class="content">When you use 'make-host' to make an Android build project from a template, you inherit the setup of the Android workspace and Manifest, which isn't maybe set up for how your app is supposed to work: and thus you should *always* double-check the host configuration/setup as a last-step when making the template work for a build for your App.  If you need Landscape orientation, don't assume that the MOAI host for Android is set up for that; same is true for iOS, and all other host build projects that typically go into making a cross-platform release.<br /><br />MOAI runs under the constraints of the Host, in a little GL ES window.  The orientation and physical configuration of the device is done in the Host level, MOAI then just plays along.  If all looks good in your MOAI code, but yet you're still getting dizzy results, head into the Host project and double-check, nay triple-check, all your expectations of behaviour.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks ibisum that was very helpful. I managed to rotate the app into portrait mode, but it is still downscaled and in now hugging the bottom left corner. I now understand that the issue is within the Manifest. Could you post an appropriate Android Manifest to learn from? Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">I just figured out what is going on...my veiwport size was set too small. Is there a function or variable that holds width and height of the actual device. I have a feeling that if I put a 480x800 viewport on a iPod Touch that it will not scale. <br /><br />The manifest would still be good. In Eclipse, I am getting a lot of flags thrown about the order of the Manifest and cannot build until I fix it, but in the terminal it builds and runs just fine.</div>

				<div class="content">Have a very deep look at MOAIEnvironment, it is what your app should be checking out first of all to find out what it is running on, what other constraints you might like to know about, and so on .. <br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="viewtopic.php%3Ff=9&amp;t=483&amp;start=60&amp;view=print.html#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code style="line-height: 30%;"><ol class="" style="font-family:monospace;"><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">-- get MOAI's settings</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">screen_width = nil or MOAIEnvironment.horizontalResolution</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">screen_height = nil or MOAIEnvironment.verticalResolution</div></li><br /><li style="line-height: 50%;"><div style="font: normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace; margin:0; padding:0; background:none; vertical-align:top;">&nbsp;</div></li><br /></ol></code></dd></dl><br /><br />There are many other things in MOAIEnvironment you'll probably want to know about, such as device features and so on, so worth digging deeper.  Also, beware: it had some refactor'ing that didn't make its way to samples, fields have been changed, so use the docs, bruce .. but also check the code.</div>
