				<div class="content">For grins and giggles I got an MK802 PC-on-a-stick recently, and wired it up to my lapdock .. installed lubuntu-mk802 (Ubuntu with lxde wm) .. and just spent the last hour building shadowmints' fork of MOAI for Linux.<br /><br />And: it works!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  So this means that you can plug in a $50 device into your home TV and run MOAI on it, nice and smooth!<br /><br />Just wanted to share that detail, in case anyone is looking for a new toy to play with .. and I have to say that having MOAI onboard such a small, light, cheap device just feels really, really good .. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />EDIT: its this thing:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.miniand.com/products/MK802%20Android%20Mini%20PC">https://www.miniand.com/products/MK802% ... 0Mini%20PC</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, it runs Android out of the box .. and all my existing MOAI apps run smoothly on it, too, in Android mode ..</div>

				<div class="content">Thats fantastic! I've been looking at some of these new mini Android plug-in devices because I want something to run Android on my tv while I wait for ouya. Any reason you got the MK802 over the MK803? Also, what are you using to control it? I was thinking about getting a blutooth media keyboard/touchpad.</div>

				<div class="content">I've got a few of these things on my desk at the moment, the MK802 was just the first one I picked up to use, no reason.  I've got a Motorola Lapdock wired up for them all, its a terrific setup to be honest and if it weren't for the jury-rigging I'd probably consider using this as a netbook/laptop replacement in the near future.  Maybe if I get some time on a 3D printer to create a suitable housing.. but if you're just going to plug it into your TV for casual use, you can probably just make do with the DroidMote server that they come with, which lets you control the thing from another Android phone .. for my needs, I won't be running Android on it much, Ubuntu instead, and this means I can get away with using Synergy too, which is already used in my setup.<br /><br />Let me know if you get something like this - it sure is nice to see MOAI running on such inexpensive hardware.  I think there could be a viable business with taking these things, installing custom software on them, and re-selling them .. especially when, in bulk, you can get MK803/MK808 hardware at $15/each.  !!!</div>

				<div class="content">I made a custom cable. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  The lapdock has USB out and HDMI out, so its really just a mouse/keyboard/HDMI-monitor in a nice laptop-shaped package - albeit, the connectors are the wrong sex.  So I got a few adapters and built my own cable to go from the Lapdock outputs to the MK802 inputs.  Its all quite well documented here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.robpol86.com/index.php/Atrix_Lapdock_Other_Uses">http://www.robpol86.com/index.php/Atrix ... Other_Uses</a><!-- m --><br /><br />As well as all over the web:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfdKq33WgHw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfdKq33WgHw</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />I have to say, its a pretty damn nice machine once you get it working, and if but for the cable mess, I'd be using it constantly.  Luckily, I have access to a laser cutter and 3d printer, so hopefully some time this week I'll build a housing for the rig that makes it a lot more robust.</div>

				<div class="content">That's awesome, I didn't know you could get the lapdock so cheap! I'll definitely be picking one up to mess with, not sure if I want to use bulky mhl adapter with it so I can use my Galaxy S2, but it looks like you could make a custom cable pretty easily for Android devices with HDMI out. Mind putting up some pictures of your setup?</div>

				<div class="content">Its not sexy, but here's the rig:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.minus.com/jcw0CRY3RmSpU_xs.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />(Bigger pic here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://minus.com/lcw0CRY3RmSpU">http://minus.com/lcw0CRY3RmSpU</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br />MOAI running on it:<br /><img src="http://i.minus.com/jtMEhVC9ZbBD5_xs.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />(<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://minus.com/ltMEhVC9ZbBD5">http://minus.com/ltMEhVC9ZbBD5</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br />Like I said, I'll be working on reducing this down to a neat plugin adapter over the next week or so, using the tools at metalab.at (3dprinter/lasercutter) .. if I can get it to the point where its just a neat slide-in arrangement without all the cable junk, I'll be very happy ..<br /><br /><br />One idea really intrigues me: buying these things in bulk, loading up a custom MOAI app, and selling to customers that way.  In bulk, these sticks can be had for $15US .. imagine selling them to customers to just plug into your TV with your app pre-configured onboard to just boot up and work.  Fascinating times ahead ..</div>

				<div class="content">I've done a lot computer modding so this definitely interests me.. I'll probably get one of these for my living room tv, I wouldn't mind getting another one with a lapdock too.<br /><br />That's insane that they're only $15 in bulk orders. Someone could put a media center type of app on there, bundle it with a $30 blutooth keyboard/trackpad and sell it for a good profit. I expect to see android powered tvs to become more popular in the near future, a lot of big manufacturers like Samsung and Sony are already selling them. The future seems good for indie game devs.</div>
