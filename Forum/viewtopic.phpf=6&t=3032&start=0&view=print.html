				<div class="content">Thanks! We're using box2d..! <br /><br />- First we were wondering if it runs smoothly on low end devices but looks great at least on those cheap dual core phones, 40-60 FPS easily..!<br /><br />- Any improvement suggestions highly appreciated! Our plan is to release iOS version next and make some graphics improvements to Android version as well.<br /><br />Oh, and we just got our 1000th player today! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />// JKON</div>

				<div class="content">Yo just a headsup, I'm getting 20-25 fps on a HP Touchpad and not all your text fits on the screen with a 1024x768 resolution, some of it is gets cut off during gameplay. I wouldn't worry too much about the fps though. It's a pretty old device plus I saw someone with a samsung galaxy s2 giving your game a 5 star review so performance is probably better on other devices.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br />Good job <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> it works well on my Galaxy S2. I guess you used RUBE editor? <br />The gameplay is fine! I didn't went through the entire game but it seems fair.<br />The only little drawback I see is about the menu interfaces (I know how it's difficult to make a good UI, meh). I think that the first menu you see when you launch the game is important. Here it is original but I guess the slide is a bit disconcerting (I mean, the moving effect when you click is cool, but when it slide because you slided your finger it is strange. I don't know if it's clear, I'm tired ^_^) Why don't you show us a beautifull bike on the welcome menu? :p<br /><br />At the end of levels there is many stats printed, they are small and it makes a lot of text with the usefull butons on the left. Imagine someone who want to retry or go to next level and don't care about those stats, his eyes may get lost. Last night I was trying your game and at a moment I misclicked, so I went to next level instead of retrying the current one. Maybe these buttons are too close from each other?<br /><br />Keep that up <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

Let's see if we can somehow use it in the menu in next version. I'm really happy with the game logo and i would like to put it there somewhere. <br /><br />Now the menu navigation is quite simple, you slide forward or backward on the menu. I was hoping to get it maybe more intuitive so that then you press the menu item it slides to next menu screen and then you can slide back by dragging the screen back to the previous menu. Maybe the threshold for dragging needs to be higher so that you don't go back/forward by accident. <br /><br />- Good points also about the end screen. The text is too small, and we've got quite a lot feedback no that. We are gonna fix it on the next version as well as make the buttons stand out a bit more..!<br /><br />// JKON</div>
