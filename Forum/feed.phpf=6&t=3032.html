Let's see if we can somehow use it in the menu in next version. I'm really happy with the game logo and i would like to put it there somewhere. <br /><br />Now the menu navigation is quite simple, you slide forward or backward on the menu. I was hoping to get it maybe more intuitive so that then you press the menu item it slides to next menu screen and then you can slide back by dragging the screen back to the previous menu. Maybe the threshold for dragging needs to be higher so that you don't go back/forward by accident. <br /><br />- Good points also about the end screen. The text is too small, and we've got quite a lot feedback no that. We are gonna fix it on the next version as well as make the buttons stand out a bit more..!<br /><br />// JKON<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">JKON</a> — Tue Jan 27, 2015 2:33 am</p><hr />

Thanks! We're using box2d..! <br /><br />- First we were wondering if it runs smoothly on low end devices but looks great at least on those cheap dual core phones, 40-60 FPS easily..!<br /><br />- Any improvement suggestions highly appreciated! Our plan is to release iOS version next and make some graphics improvements to Android version as well.<br /><br />Oh, and we just got our 1000th player today! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />// JKON<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">JKON</a> — Sun Jan 25, 2015 6:54 am</p><hr />
