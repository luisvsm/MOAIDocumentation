It would be great if you could include binaries in the release (maybe moai-untz) that were compiled with UNTZ flags to alleviate the process of rebuilding a host - and also allow people who don't have Visual Studio to test for Sound on their PC (like using a PC as a dev machine, obviously you'd need VS for releasing on Windows <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)</div></blockquote><br /><br />Mh.. strange.. <br />I've just downloaded 1.4p0 (just to try a fresh download) and ran samples/audio/audio-untz.lua and it works with bin/osx/moai.<br /><br />I'll try windows later, but at least mac is working.</div>

				<div class="content">Just pulled the source code for the Github I can't compile neither iOS nor OSX hosts any more.<br />Looks like folder names changed without updating the Xcode project (ie. src/moaicore/ became src/moai-core/, but the code was not updated). <br />Opened Xcode project for libmoai, and the problem is obvious: <span style="font-weight: bold">all source files are missing</span> due to this mess with folders.  Oh boy... *sigh*... this is a complete nightmare, how can such a mess get to main fork?</div>

				<div class="content">For sanity sake, we are locally here in Vienna sticking to  3b61182 Patrick Meehan (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/commit/3b611827aa41fc1c96c2fb4d0bba8dcac68578d7">https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/commit ... cac68578d7</a><!-- m -->) as our baseline, for now.  It seems we must proceed with caution while ZL get the re-org of the MOAI build-tree completed, (*) or probably stick with the official releases and develop awareness of bug-fixes with caution, and so on ..<br /><br />(*- I think the re-org is being done to make all platforms use a common build system right now, instead of the somewhat fragmented gathering of developer tools spread over the tree, but this is a good thing, imho, but maybe the re-org tree was a bit fresh to be pushed to master, after all it is a broken build, Edit: *grr* ..)</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the help, @ibisum, I was just about to go completely crazy. Downloading it now. This latest build really shouldn't be pushed to master, although I appreciate that the common build system is being built at the moment, as it is so baaadly needed! Would be great if we could get some estimate on when it might be finished. I am kinda hesitant to start updating the 3b61182 if the new build (which is obviously be very, very different) is coming up in a matter of days.</div>

I too found it troubling that the master branch was broken.  The commits being made have been consistently broken.  I had created a post here: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="recent-commit-breaks-everything-t1825/index.html">recent-commit-breaks-everything-t1825/</a><!-- l --> which seems to be answered by your recent post.<br /><br />I'll link off to your post from there.  I figured working off those earlier working revisions would be solution.</div>
