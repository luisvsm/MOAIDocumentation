				<div class="content">I just wanted to bump this and strongly agree with Ibisum. <br /><br />Keyboard functionality is a pretty basic need for most games, and non-system software keyboards are kind of cheazy for anything beyond &quot;Enter Your Initials&quot;. <br />To be honest, I'm surprised Moai has come this far without keyboard support!</div>

				<div class="content">I emailed the latest code to adam.  (i'm kind of a git newbie so that is easier than a pull for now).  After some time I was able to break most of the code into a MoaiKeyboard.java file.  The important fix was to use the AKU thread protection to prevent the app from exploding when someone hits or holds the delete key.  <br /><br />Still some cleaning up to do but we've got this keyboard running in the wild without any issues.   (there is a minor issue with getting the done button event on samsung phones.  Can't seem to see this to tell when the keyboard should be dismissed.  Also, I've been told the back button should dismiss the keyboard as well, whereas right now the code dismisses and clears the text)</div>

				<div class="content">Did you also include the extension to IMEKeyboardTrap, so that you can actually get the Back/Done button events separately?  This was needed.<br /><br />Great to hear that you got things caught up and I look forward to seeing this in the next MOAI sdk release .. cool that we got it sorted as a team.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know what has happened to this work, but in case its needed, I realized that I have done it already in my own branch of moai-dev, here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/seclorum/moai-dev">https://github.com/seclorum/moai-dev</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There was some attempt to get this integrated into moai-dev/master, but I don't know whats happened with that.  Maybe adam and/or stephensullivan know something more?  Since I get a request for this work about once a week, I would hope this would somehow make it into master - seems like my pull request from 3 months ago got ignored, somehow.</div>

				<div class="content">@ibisum - Have you made many other changes in your branch?  Should I just be able to drop the android keyboard class into the vanilla moai-dev and then build it?<br /><br />EDIT:  I added your android keyboard class and rebuilt moai, but then when trying to access it in my lua code:  &quot;attempt to index global 'MOAIKeyboardAndroid' (a nil value)&quot;<br /><br />I can only assume that somehow the MOAIKeyboardAndroid class didn't get built into moai.  Is there something I need to do to make it be included in the build?  ie add it to a build script or something.</div>

				<div class="content">There is a lot more to it than just the Android class - you also need the Host templates in ant/host-source too, and .. well then you have to use make-host.sh to re-build an Android host project, and so on.  Much better would be if it get merged with moai-dev mainline somehow, because frankly its a lot of stuff that has to be in the right place ..</div>
