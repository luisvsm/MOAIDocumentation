@BlueByLiquid, that's a pretty cool suggestion. I hadn't really thought about something like that. I don't know how well we personally could pull it off, however. They guy who has been working on our animations so far isn't one of our core team members (hence us having to pay him) and lives in another state. <br /><br />@patrick, thanks for the enthusiasm. It's been a fun project to work on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1004">ignisdeveloper</a> — Fri Aug 31, 2012 3:16 am</p><hr />

You could also probably get some of the game art croud by having some sort of tier for private forum access where they can view timelapse or screencast videos of one or two of the animations being created. There is a huge fan base for knowing how to create good art and really you would only have to do a video while the animations are being created so it shouldn't be much cost or effort there. possibly you could have the artist later go back and provide some voice over.<br /><br />There is something amazing about seeing a still piece of concept art go from creation to life in the hands of an animator and to see that done on the scale you are doing would be amazing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=879">BlueByLiquid</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2012 5:12 am</p><hr />

That's a very good point. Now that I think about, I would probably be more inclined to support a project that advances open source software myself. I think we might at least put it in the FAQs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1004">ignisdeveloper</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2012 1:58 am</p><hr />

ignis,<br /><br />Oh I didn't care about credit moai I thought it would be in your best interest. I think often people support projects simply because they feel passionate about the technology behind them. Many people support open source based project or in your case projects that demonstrate the use of open source technologies especially on kickstarter.<br /><br />For example I wouldn't have even looked at your kickstarter had I not seen todd's post on twitter saying that you were using MOAI. I wouldn't say make it prominent but I think mentioning you are using open source tools will attract a fair number of people and possible get other sites to mention you when they talk about MOAI therefore a win win for everyone.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=879">BlueByLiquid</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2012 1:40 am</p><hr />

We plan on crediting Moai in the official game release (obviously), but we weren't sure how interested our Kickstarter backers might be in the particular technologies that we are using. It doesn't look like Double Fine mentioned Moai in their Kickstarter either. We love open source, and Moai has been great to work with - I love how cross platform it is, but we didn't want to distract people with details that the average gamer might not understand or care about. When we get a chance to update our own website however, we would definitely like to highlight our our use of open source technologies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1004">ignisdeveloper</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2012 1:01 am</p><hr />

You might mention on your kickstart that you are using the MOAI engine as people probably would like to know you are using an open source engine.

Hey fellow devs. We just Kickstarted a new Moai-powered game, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888104893/deozoa-legends-of-eden" class="postlink">Deozoa: Legends of Eden</a>. Deozoa is a monster catching video game combining the rich storytelling of an RPG with the combat system of a turn based strategy. As you explore through the world you will discover and capture over 100 monsters called Deozoa. Unlike other monster games, your 11 playable human characters battle side by side with their Deozoa to fight their way to victory.<br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888104893/deozoa-legends-of-eden" class="postlink"><img src="http://deozoa.com/images/mainimage_largeb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />One thing that we are doing a little differently is that we are pursuing more of a community driven development model. Growing up, we played a lot of Pokemon and always wished there was some channel to get our own monster ideas into the official games. While we are now older, wiser, and understand that we can't just include every single monster idea into our game, we are really excited to provide a means for our fans to submit monster ideas in polls and contests and to allow the top ones to become official Deozoa. Obviously, we will have our own artists redraw the winning submissions (if necessary) to fit within a consistent art style. We are also discussing options to streamline modding of our game to allow people to insert their own unofficial monsters into their own game. We will also be giving our fans the opportunity to build out some of the descriptions, stats, and backstory for some of the monsters. <br /><br />A few key features:<br /><ul><li>One time game purchase for all monsters, characters, and story. No in-app purchases, no monthly fees. Just buy the game and have it forever. The game will be developed for iOS (iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch) and Android (phone and tablet), with an eventual release to PC, Mac, Linux, and Ouya.</li><li>Capture and befriend over 100 monsters: Each teammate can be assigned one Deozoa to fight with them on the battlefield.</li><li>Evolve your Deozoa: Like animals that grow from baby to adult, all of our Deozoa will grow into a new form as they mature. There are typically two to three monsters per family.</li><li>Recruit 10 characters to your team: As you progress through the story, you will encounter 10 available warriors looking for an adventure. Determine the best combination of abilities to give yourself an edge on the battlefield.</li><li>Level up and upgrade human classes: There are 10 classes of human warriors to battle, each with their own unique stats and strengths. As enemies get tougher and the heroes get stronger, every class can develop into an advanced form for stat boosts.</li><li>Use the elements to your advantage: There are 12 elements that all Deozoa and attacks fall into. Every element will have strengths and weaknesses against other elements, making each battle unique and challenging.</li><li>Fight in a free-form battling system: Position 6 teammates with an open movement system unrestrained by a grid. The size of a unit can block enemies’ movement to redirect their attacks, protect weaker units, and form a front line.</li><li>Rich RPG storyline: Unlike casual games, you will explore through a fun RPG story with an expected eight hours of gameplay in a single play through.</li></ul><br />We will probably be using the Moai cloud to allow players to sync their data across multiple devices.<br /><br />For more information, please check out our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888104893/deozoa-legends-of-eden" class="postlink">Kickstarter project</a> and like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IgnisStudios" class="postlink">Facebook</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1004">ignisdeveloper</a> — Sun Aug 26, 2012 1:42 am</p><hr />
