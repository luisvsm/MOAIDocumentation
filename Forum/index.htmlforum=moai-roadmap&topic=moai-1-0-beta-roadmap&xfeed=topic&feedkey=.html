	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the forum. :)</p>
<p>1 – Moai can merge with Cocos2D inasmuch as you can link Moai SDK in with your Cocos2D app. That said, Moai SDK is really an alternative to a library like Cocos2D. I&#039;ll say more in the answer to 3.</p>
<p>2 – I think that&#039;s a great idea. Moai Cloud should make an ideal back end for your Cocos2D game. If you need rich logic and data persistence on the server, you can write it all in Lua and talk to it over HTTP. Up to you how to set things up and return your data.</p>
<p>3 – Moai SDK is similar to Cocos2D in a lot of ways. The differences are that Moai is written in 100% C/C++ and has Lua integration built in from the ground up. You can use Moai SDK as a C++ library (just as you might use Cocos2D as an obj-c library), but the quicker path is to use the Lua interface for most of your game setup and logic and to extend Moai using either Lua wrappers or by writing custom additions to the C++ framework. Even if you&#039;re a C++ expert, you can still put things together a lot faster using Lua and just go back to C++ as needed. </p>
<p>The C++ implementation means Moai SDK can run natively on iPhone, Android, Mac, PC, etc. I think there&#039;s a current Cocos2D port to Android, but it&#039;s written in Java, so I&#039;d have questions about performance.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you&#039;re comfortable with obj-c and iPhone, Cocos2D is fine. You can still use Moai Cloud to write your back end in Lua.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello. I am from Summit Applications Corporation. We are very active on App Store and now have 30+ games on line, and will launch 150+ games this year.</p>
<p>Currently we mainly used Cocos2d. Hope we can benefit from Moai. So I have some questions here:</p>
<p>1. Can Moai SDK merge with Cocos2d? for cocos2d now is very popular, and very stable.</p>
<p>2. Hope to use Moai cloud to make on line games combining with Cocos2d, for example on-line sharing level configuration, competition and so on.</p>
<p>3. What can we benefit from using Moai SDK besides Cocos2d? <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Hope to see Moai grows fast and see more games mad by Moai.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Can&#039;t hurt to sign up for the beta, though there are only a few slots opening up each week. I think you can leave the &#039;Company&#039; field blank.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone. I would like to congratulate and thank Zipline team for<br />
his job. I feel very excited about Moai, I was wondering "Woah, it would<br />
 be great if there were some kind of open SDK to build games for both<br />
Android and iOS" and then I found this out of the blue - this project<br />
will have a great future for sure.</p>
<p>I&#039;m not a beta tester, i&#039;m not even a developer in a video games<br />
company, but I just would like to try the SDK and, just in case, report<br />
problems or any other thing. Should I request a beta account or just<br />
wait the 60 beta days? (I&#039;m asking because there is a "Company"<br />
requested field in the beta requesting form).</p>
