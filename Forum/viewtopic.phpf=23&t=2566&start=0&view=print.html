				<div class="content">aww man, I drew a line through fmod as commercial and as such not worth supporting in a community/opensource build. Now it probably need integration and testing and cmake scripts etc.  What does this give over untz?</div>

				<div class="content">I has more features such as pitch-shifting.  However I'm inclined to wait a while and see what the license and how organizations like EFF analyze it before throwing away Untz.  Surely it's not opensource so that is at least one strike still against it.</div>

				<div class="content">Guys, there is a difference between FMOD Studio and FMOD Ex. FMOD Ex provides the API and it still has the $500 per platform price tag for indies. I may be wrong here but FMOD Studio is tool only for creating sounds, not an API that you can integrate in a project.</div>

				<div class="content">from fmod.org: &quot;FMOD Ex is the older generation technology used in thousands of commercial titles. Go here to get up to date builds that are still maintained for existing platforms and titles. Use FMOD Studio if you want to be up to date with the latest in audio technology and workflow.&quot;<br /><br />So there's fmod studio and fmod studio API's which are free for indies, so you can create sounds and play them etc. It might make sense to put FMOD back into Moai given this.</div>

Do you have a link to any clear statement that the studio API is free for indies? But it does seem that you are right.. Studio is free and Studio API is a part of Studio. I'll probably mail them when it's time to fix sound.</div>

				<div class="content">front page says it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fmod.org">http://www.fmod.org</a><!-- m --><br /><br />and more specifically : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fmod.org/category/news/">http://www.fmod.org/category/news/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />&quot;FMOD now free for indies! Unity integration released.<br />March 11, 2014<br />Firelight Technologies announced today that its next generation audio tool suite, FMOD Studio, is now free for indie developers. FMOD Studio has always been free for non-commercial projects, and from today it will also be free for commercial indie projects.<br /><br />&quot;We started out as an indie company so we've always felt an affinity with the indie community.&quot; said Firelight Technologies CEO Brett Paterson. &quot;They're risk takers, innovators and explorers. We wanted to give back to that community and we can’t wait to see what they do with FMOD Studio.&quot;<br /><br />Firelight Technologies recently released FMOD Studio 1.3 with new features specifically for indie developers:<br /><br />· Unity integration plug-in<br />· Plugin SDK for creating sound generators and effects with examples on GitHub<br /><br />These additions come on top of an industry-leading feature set that includes an intuitive and familiar UI, an all-in-one multi-track editor for interactive music and sound effects, and a full-featured mixing desk with dynamic mixer snapshots and control surface support, as well as supporting cross-platform authoring on both PC and Mac.<br /><br />Since its release last year, FMOD Studio has already been used in a number of AAA titles, including Forza Motorsport 5, which recently won an IGN award for best audio on Xbox One. FMOD Studio is also proving to be popular with iOS and Android developers, with several unannounced titles due in the coming months.&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">Untz was one of the main reasons I couldn't port and update my current game to Moai as Untz doesn't support pitch shifting which I used heavily in my game. I intended to help create a new sound system for Moai but could not find the spare time. Having the current version of FMOD working with Moai would be huge for me.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/bslayerw" class="postlink">https://github.com/bslayerw</a></div>
