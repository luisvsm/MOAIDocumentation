				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />If anyone is interested, I am currently available for hire as a MOAI developer. I have been using MOAI for a year, and have published &quot;Rauchfrei Durchstarten&quot; to the iOS/Android app stores, as well as produced a number of apps for clients which have not yet hit the stores.  I have experience with extending the MOAI host code (see my work on MOAIKeyboardAndroid in the forums) as well as production experience with the other features of the MOAI API - physics, asset management, GUI frameworks and so on.  I have contributed to the moaigui framework a few minor bugfixes, as well as to the main MOAI host repo, and I would be very happy to have the opportunity to continue working in MOAI in the near future.<br /><br />If you need an independent developer to get into your MOAI project and help out with a tight timetable, I'm your man.  Please contact me for further references and details!</div>

				<div class="content">I would love to do that!  Also, I'd love to spend some time writing tutorials .. actually, I'd be happy doing anything related to MOAI these days.  I guess I'm a fanboix!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">If your just dying to do tutorials one showing a Tiled tilemap with a simple character would be awesome because I haven't seen anything showing a thumb joystick like controller would be great like most other frameworks have. Also might be a good demonstrator for potential clients. Plus you could probably sell the tutorials like many other sites do for frameworks. Sorry to clutter your thread with non-sense.</div>
