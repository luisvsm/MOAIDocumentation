				<div class="content">How complete is the Tapjoy integration? <br /><br />According to the Moai documentation <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/docs/class_m_o_a_i_tapjoy_android.html" class="postlink">here</a>, it doesn't even seem complete enough to make the included demo work.  <br />A glance at the source code seems to confirm what the documentation says, but I may be missing something.<br /><br />I'm particularly interested in using both ad banners and a TapJoy-managed in-game currency, but the documentation seems to indicate that support for those isn't in there yet.<br /><br />I figure I must be reading something wrong, because what good is an offer wall without an in-game currency?</div>

				<div class="content">If you look at Wolf Toss, we are using the Tapjoy offer wall, but I think we manage our own virtual currency. I don't believe we have integrated the banner support yet.<br /><br />I will ask Eric to write it up for you on Monday.</div>

				<div class="content">In Wolf Toss we do manage our own in game currency. This leaves us open to being able to have multiple third party services show offers to our users. For example, we use both Tapjoy and Ad Colony, as well as giving out coins as incentives to post to Twitter, etc. ourselves. Also, banner support has not been implemented.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the response. <br /><br />How do you determine when the user has earned coins via the ad-wall?   Looking at TapJoy's documentation it seems like that involves functions that aren't brought through to Moai, but I must be wrong, since you're doing it.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, banner support has not been implemented.</div></blockquote><br />Oh. Too bad.   I thought it was because it's mentioned in one of the samples.</div>

				<div class="content">We have two samples for Tapjoy, it appears:<br />    samples/app/app-tapjoy<br />    samples/ios/app-tapjoy<br /><br />The first one is old, and has not been maintained. It uses a tapjoy.lua Lua module to hit Tapjoy's web API. We have switched over to using Tapjoy's native SDK which is what the second sample provides an example of.<br /><br />When you set up virtual currency on your Tapjoy dashboard, you are asked to provide a callback URL if you are maintaining the virtual currency yourself. This URL gets hit every time a user completes an offer. It lets you know which user and how much currency to award. We do not have a sample on how to do that, however, Tapjoy's knowledge center would be a good place to start: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://knowledge.tapjoy.com/">http://knowledge.tapjoy.com/</a><!-- m -->.</div>

				<div class="content">Ah. That makes sense. I was looking at the wrong demo. That explains why It didn't seem to match the MOAI docs. <br /><br />I guess integrating Tapjoy into my app would be harder than I thought, as it would need server-side support. Oh well. <br /><br />Thanks for the response.<br /><br />-Andy</div>

				<div class="content">Andy - we will improve that sample. Thanks for pointing it out.<br /><br />Also, we have written all the server side code for Tapjoy on Moai Cloud and would be happy to share it.</div>
