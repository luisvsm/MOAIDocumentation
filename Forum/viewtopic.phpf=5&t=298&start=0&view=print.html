				<div class="content">Hello,
<br />
<br />Congratulations for the project!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I want to contribute but I need to learn first... my suggestion is:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Easy documentation showing how to start (no long texts and more step by step with screen shots);
<br />
<br />2. More sample projects and instructions about how to run ir... (I'm trying to run the samples in a Mac, I'm develop for Android and iOS);
<br />
<br />3. How to create libraries, I'm want to contribute creating high level libraries to make the development fast for everybody.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thank you</div>

				<div class="content">Hello tecnalta,
<br />
<br />I would love to help implement this suggestion.  We can start by collecting the required information here, determine what is missing and what needs to be improved, and then update the Wiki and included documentation.
<br />
<br />To me, one thing that gets a lot of new users is the fact there is a <a href="https://dashboard.moaicloud.com/download.php" target="_blank">Moai SDK with precompiled libs in the Dashboard</a> (which I use and am grateful for), and the full, latest, beta project in <a href="https://github.com/moai" target="_blank">GitHub</a> — and they each have different set ups and issues.
<br />
<br />To begin,
<br />
<br />(1) How was your attempt to learn how to start, and where did you feel it should be improved? 
<br />
<br />(2) I recently posted 9 steps (<a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/new-users/is-there-a-not-xcode-simulator-on-mac/" target="_blank">click here</a>) to run the samples in a Mac.  Would something like this satisfy you, and if not, how could it be improved?
<br />
<br />(3) Regarding libraries, I myself would like more feedback in this area.  For example, I require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" target="_blank">MD5</a>, and there is a lua library for it (<a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/md5/" target="_blank">click here</a>).  However, I am not completely excited about implementing it since my Apps are for iOS, Android, Chrome, OSX, <em>and </em>Win32.  I believe I would have to add it to each platform's project — this makes me wish for a Lua Script version, so I know it would work on all platforms with no implementation issues.  Perhaps for me, this MD5 issue is the perfect gateway to document creating Lua libraries.  There is the<a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/wiki/Extending_Moai_SDK" target="_blank"> Extending Moai SDK</a> section. 
<br />
<br />I look forward to any feedback. </div>

				<div class="content">I would be interested in contributing to the doc's as well, I might just start writing down what I've learned about MOAI somewhere on the Wiki.
<br />
<br />As to what it was like starting out, I think the sample projects are awesome, but need to be filled with comments. Even technically minded people enjoy having tons of explanation's about whats going on when they encounter a new environment.
<br />
<br />My biggest gripe with the documentation at the moment is how unhelpful the <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/docs/" target="_blank">SDK Docs</a> can be in some places. A great first improvement would be to make it so inherited members show up on the main page of a class, instead of on a sub-page.</div>

				<div class="content">Sometimes we do not add to the Wiki because our thoughts are rough around the edges.  If we create our own blogs about Moai, we could then Wiki the best parts, in an organized fashion, when ready.
<br />
<br />The blogs will come up from Moai googles, and we could even have a blog link section in the Wiki.
<br />
<br />The point of this memo, is a kind reminder that the Wiki and Forum does not have to be the only helpful place to publish all our research and experiences.  I, myself, have picked up much valuable Moai information from other Moai blogs, just from googling Moai, and the issue.

<br />Great, Mervill.  New wiki account info should be waiting for you in your inbox.

				<div class="content">My other suggestion is change moai from a "Mobile Platform for Game Developers" to a "Platform for Mobile Application Developers".
<br />
<br />In my company we search for platforms to develop mobile applications and this view point can avoid the use of moai, because moai target is development of Games.
<br />
<br />Moai want to be a platform to development of applications too, right? Lets not forget this point.</div>
