<br />
<br />The <a href="http://www.ziplinegames.com" target="_blank">Zipline Games Studio</a> just released their first game, <a href="http://www.ziplinegames.com/games/wolf-toss" target="_blank"><em>Wolf Toss</em></a>, simultaneously to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wolf-toss/id461992615?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ziplinegames.wolftoss" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pjlncddmdljpioccbmempchonhlifakc" target="_blank">Chrome</a> (via <a href="http://www.gonacl.com" target="_blank">NaCl</a>).  The whole game was written in Lua using Moai by a small studio team with 2 programmers.  With three worlds to explore and 144 different levels to play across the various difficulty settings, the studio team was working hard on level design, game balance, and game art right up to release day.
<br />
<br />We'll get an interview posted soon, but right now the <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Moai/news.asp?c=35943" target="_blank">news sites are covering that</a> and we're just thrilled that "released for half a billion devices" and "made with Moai with 2 programmers" are the new standard for broad reach mobile games.
<br />
<br />Check out the Wolf Toss <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAAJw2NZr0" target="_blank">Trailer Video</a> and the <a href="http://www.ziplinegames.com/games/wolf-toss" target="_blank">Game page</a>.  And download and play the game!</div>

				<div class="content">I was waiting for website links to activate. Excellent!?
<br />Tried to download on iTouch2G. Wasn't compatible. Apple definitely wants me to buy a new idevice.
<br />I look forward to playing on Chrome as I doubt my phone (zte blade/ San fransisco) will be able to handle it. (it has trouble with angry birds)
<br />
<br />I take the above back - the game runs VERY smoothly on my phone. Impressive!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Andrew. Glad it's working for you. Targetting pre-3GS iOS devices is tough, but we could probably get there with some time and tuning. Is it worth it? Good question.
<br />
<br />

				<div class="content">Moai runs great, Box2D less so. Our designers went nuts on the iDevices with level design... hundreds of physics bodies, etc. Runs fine even on 3GS. But... had we been more disciplined about testing on Android I think we would have been more conservative in our level design.
<br />
<br />We'll get there with some optimizations and reeling in the levels a bit, but wanted to limit the install base to devices most likely to be able to run the physics smoothly at first.
<br />
<br />Just another example of the importance of testing gameplay on *all* target devices. Not a Moai problem, just us (re)learning one of those fundamental axioms of game design.
<br />
<br />So... the moral of the story: don't be afraid to use Moai on Android but, like anything, test early, test often and adjust your design accordingly.</div>

				<div class="content">Slightly off-topic, but I came across this alternative market which features Wolf Toss (among many others):
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.appsbidder.com/app_details.php?name=Wolf-Toss&app_id=7649&parent_id=&category_id=2355" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appsbidder.com/app_.....ry_id=2355</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />and I'm wondering if Zipline uploaded that to their store or are they just scraping the official market?</div>

				<div class="content">They are scraping the market - illegally I might add. Just because it's free doesn't mean you can copy it.<br /><br />It's tough to do much about it, especially the Chinese sites. We don't recommend people use these sites - see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://zipline.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/41008-is-it-ok-to-download-wolf-toss-from-an-unofficial-">https://zipline.uservoice.com/knowledge ... nofficial-</a><!-- m --></div>
