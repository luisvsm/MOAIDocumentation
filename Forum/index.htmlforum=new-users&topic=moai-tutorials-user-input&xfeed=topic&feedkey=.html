	<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
I need halp, what is a cluster, and i looked at your hello tutorial, your cluster is public, mine is shared. Can you explain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the confusion.  The term "public" is a typo in the tutorial documentation.  It should be "shared."</p>
<p>A Moai Cloud cluster is a group of redundant, load-balanced application servers that are responsible for hosting your Moai Cloud applications.  The default cluster is "shared", meaning that your application is running on a cluster that is shared with other Moai Cloud customers.  In most cases, the shared cluster will be adequate for supporting your application.  </p>
<p>However, if you find that your Moai Cloud application is receiving large volumes of traffic or if you need more functionality than is provided by the default Lua sandbox, we can create a private, dedicated cluster for you that will be used solely for your applications.  If you&#039;re interested in setting up a private cluster, please let us know and we&#039;ll work with you to get one set up.</p>

<p>Does moai have a debugger, and emulater, because that would be helpful. I have used corona, but moai is complicated, can telll me how to create a app?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, Moai does not have a debugger or emulator. However, there are several contributors working on such things. One open source project is Akuma, which is the beginnings of a more fully-featured host for Windows: <a href="https://github.com/bullno1/Akuma" target="_blank">https://github.com/bullno1/Akuma</a></p>
<p>I recommend going over the samples provided in the Moai SDK. Each sample can be run by simply executing the run script. The code for the sample is usually located in main.lua.</p>
<p>Check out our various tutorials as well here: <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/category/blog/moai-platform-tutorials/" target="_blank">/category/bl.....tutorials/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you publish a tutorial on how to make something move?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a specific tutorial which covers this, but many of the samples do various forms of movement. You can find that tutorial here: <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/2011/06/moai-tutorials-basic-prop-animations/" target="_blank">/2011/06/moa.....nimations/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is Moai Cloud?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moai Cloud is a product which allows a Lua scripter to write a fully-featured and scale-able web back-end for their product. It can be used along side Moai SDK, or can be used standalone and integrated with any other front end. Matt, one of the chief architects of Moai Cloud, will answer more of your questions about it in another post.</p>
<p><strong>ayounus642 said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I publish my app on Android? How do I use Moai SDK?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find detailed descriptions on how to utilize all of the IDE projects in the newly released MoaiProjectSetup.pdf file located in the root of the Moai SDK zip file. There are other documents in the SDK describing various ways of using Moai, as well as readme files which describe important configuration details you&#039;ll need to know.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you have the latest version of Moai? I seem to recall that Patrick had fixed an issue that sounds similar to what you&#039;re experiencing. I just downloaded the latest release to my personal computer, copied your code, ran the file, and it worked as intended. </p>
<p>If you download it and it&#039;s still not working, let us know.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#039;m still having a little trouble with the world vs window co-ordinates. Below is a direct copy-paste of the main.lua file I made to follow this tutorial, I looked over it a few times and I think it&#039;s identical to yours? (the font is just a free .ttf I grabbed off the web)</p>
<p>When I run this, the textbox follows the pointer at the X axis, but when I move the pointer up/down, the textbox moves away from the pointer, in the opposite direction. I tried messing with the "setYFlip" line but that just flipped the text upside-down. Did I make an obvious mistake or is something else going on?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;
<pre>MOAISim.openWindow ( "Inputs", 320, 480 )

viewport = MOAIViewport.new ()
viewport:setScale ( 320, 480 )
viewport:setSize ( 320, 480 )

layer = MOAILayer2D.new ()
layer:setViewport ( viewport )
MOAISim.pushRenderPass ( layer )

charcodes = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 .,:;!?()&#38;/-"
font = MOAIFont.new()
font:loadFromTTF ( "pirulen.ttf", charcodes, 16, 163 )

textbox = MOAITextBox.new ()
textbox:setFont ( font )
textbox:setTextSize ( font:getScale ())
textbox:setRect ( -50, -50, 50, 50 )
textbox:setYFlip ( true )

function onPointerEvent ( x, y )
	mouseX, mouseY = layer:wndToWorld ( x, y )
	textbox:setLoc ( mouseX, mouseY )
	textbox:setString (tostring ( "X" .. mouseX .. " " .. "Y" .. mouseY ))
	layer:insertProp ( textbox )
end

MOAIInputMgr.device.pointer:setCallback (onPointerEvent)
</pre>
<p>&#160;</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this tutorial, we’ll talk about a few ways to capture user input,<br />
specifically pointer location and mouse clicking. We’ll do a few simple<br />
scripts and investigate two separate methods to get that input.</p>
<p>First, a note; input in Moai is determined by the host. If you look<br />
at the GlutHost.cpp file in the Moai source, down around line 240, it<br />
lists the input config.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
