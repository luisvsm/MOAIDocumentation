				<div class="content">Finally released a game, big thanks to everyone on the forums and irc for all the help and contributions to moai!<br /><br />The game is called Asterox and it's about collecting... asteroids. It's a challenging arcade game with the main goal being beating yours and other people their highscores. There's online leaderboards although I reset them for release as I didn't want my own personal scores to clutter it!<br /><br />Check it out at: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloxoft.asterox">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... ft.asterox</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you have any thoughts about what you dislike/like, would love to hear them for a next game. There's some things I wanted to change but at some point I had to call it a day and finish what I had. I've started many game projects but finishing one is definitely harder than expected!</div>

				<div class="content">Wo, this game is cool and it looks professionnal! I really want to beat the highscore <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Implementing something with google play games could be nice to see our friend's highscores maybe<br /><br />I got confused by the quote &quot;you have 0 extra lives left&quot; when I missed something the first time. I thought that the game was over because it was written 0 lives and I didn't understood clearly. But on my second game I understood better</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks halfnelson, I saw your message on irc as well!<br /><br />Cheers Bartho! The reason I didn't use google's own leaderboards is because I personally don't like having to sign in with google+ for games, but it definitely has some advantages like you said! Maybe for next game I'll consider both.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice simple yet addictive game!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />- I got the same effect as Bartho about the extra lifes.. At first it was a bit confusing because I thought the game was over but it continued.. Now it says &quot;You have lost a life&quot;, &quot;You have 0 extra lives left&quot;.. <br /><br />- Also it would be helpful to show some visual effect on the background to show that the reverse control mode is activated as sometimes I don't realize when the reverse mode ends. Not sure if this is intentional <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyway, nice game, best of luck and millions of downloads!<br /><br />// JKON</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback JKON!<br /><br />The duration of the reverse controls is indicated by the blocks that appear around the center of the screen! But in general the game is really hard, probably too hard! Also the fact you have to start over every time you lose is quite a turn off I think. <br /><br />Lots of lessons learned for a next game anyway <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
