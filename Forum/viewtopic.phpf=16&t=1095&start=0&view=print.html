				<div class="content">Hey guys,<br />(see below for custom music for your projects!)<br />I'm very pleased to announce a huge (192 minutes) music library I just wrapped up for RPG / high-fantasy adventure type games in need of professional, cinematic-style music. I've decided to make it accessable to various budgets and created 3 Editions with a &quot;new product&quot; discount of 20% off. Premium Edition is $180, Standard Edition $130, Basic Edition is $60. In a nutshell, these will give you some very, very cool cinematic combat music to tavern, village, Dungeons &amp; Cave cues, and thematic music to mystical cues.  <br /><br />..and for those who aren't needing all type of Modules found in the B/S/P Editions, the modules can be purchased separately. They're located directly below the Editions on my site.(Definitely check out the Special Cues module. These were made for rewards, reveal, failure, etc..events &amp; online/pvp &quot;capture the flag&quot;(Traditional). I highly recommend these type of cues to give a &quot;polished&quot; sound to your games).<br /><br />I hope you guys enjoy what you hear and find either an Edition version or some Modules to help finish off your game and bring it to the masses! Thanks <br /><br />guys! - custom music info below..<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- w --><br /><br /><br />About Custom Music - I work with indie game developers to produce custom music at various budgets. I currently have room for more clients so shoot me a line through my website if you're needing something unique, sounds like music from game/movie XYZ, or just not sure what your needing, perhaps we can help figure it out with you. Prices can vary greatly depending on the scope of music. Ex. you're needing a very basic ambient cue vs. full orchestra score(eg. Adventures at Castle Ebonwood from Cinematic Fantasy library or cues from Kingdom of Light) with live musicians. Prices start @ approx. $50 per minute for very basic music/padding. However, prices are negotiable with longer run times.<br /><br />Thanks all!<br />Peter<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- w --></div>

				<div class="content">I'm running some incredible deals for the month of August. And when I say incredible deals, I'm not talking about low quality music for a low price, rather AAA music at extreme, deep discounts! I provide top-tier music for those who are serious about producing excellent games for the masses. <br /><br />For SCI-FI game developers, check out 'Titan' for a large library of music and vehicle's sound fx. The list price is already absurdly low. With 45 cues, the very low list price brings each cue to a little over $2.00. The sale price bring it down further to approx. 0.99 per cue. You'll definitely want to jump on this deal if you're needing high-quality sci-fi music now or in the future.<br /><br />For ADVENTURE, RPG, MMORPG, HIGH-FANTASY game devs, the KINGDOM of LIGHT Modules and Premium, Standard, and Basic Editions remains to be an incredible deal of <br />professional AAA music at a ridiculously low price. This is truly an ALL-IN-ONE music library. This complete library ranges from epic combats, close range battles, city themes, taverns, dungeons &amp; caves, transitions, mystical environments and huge orchestral cues to name just a few. This is a serious music library for serious game developers who cannot afford $300+ per minute of cinematic custom music. If your fans of orchestra music like LOTR or Skyrim, this could be the perfect solution <br />for your epic adventure game. Check out the reviews on my site to see what people are saying about it!<br /><br />Rockstars! Character Music brings a large selection of character, menu music, game play music, AND a great selection of transition music/fx. Created for those who create games with a similar character selection as SSX, all songs are looped with a wide genre selection and named appropriately to help select the 'perfect' song.<br /><br />Need USER INTERFACE sounds? AUDIO TOUCH has a generous offering of fx, nicely categorized for fast selection. Added to the large selection of UI sounds are 20 transitional cues. Be sure to get your UI sound fx!<br /><br />For high-fantasy lovers who enjoy John Williams &amp; Danny Elfman music, Cinematic Fantasy Master Collection may be exactly what you're looking for, for your high fantasy game. These are original songs that could be set to a big budget film or big budget game. These are perfect for themes and various other placement.<br /><br />Custom music - I can be contracted out to do custom music. Orchestra, chip-tunes, ambient, sci-fi, and many other styles. For a good idea of what I can produce for you, listen to the variety of styles on my website. Need a particular type of sound that you don't hear? Contact me and we can discuss it further to get the right sound for your game! Prices start as low as $50 per minute and go up to $300 per minute for top tier music (Kingdom of Light, Cinematic Fantasy)<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Peter Gunder<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- w --></div>

				<div class="content">If you represent a game studio, a small indie developer team or an individual, I can create great sounding music for your next project!  If you're looking for professional custom cues, prices start at $50 per minute and upwards to $300 per minute. Package deals can be had so let's talk if you're serious about the full production of your game! <br /><br />For indie game devs that are on a tight budget, I also offer professional royalty-free game music. I'm still running a HUGE discount of 50% off all libraries for the next 10 days! (Purchasing libraries brings some cues to below $0.99).<br /><br />For <span style="font-weight: bold">Sci-fi music</span>, check out Atmospheric Sound Design (ASD) – Volume 1 &amp; Volume 2, ASD Sci-Fi Volume 1. And for a killer deal check out Titan. Titan combines all 3 ASD libraries and expands it with additional songs to over 45 tracks. This also includes spaceship sounds of alien and humanoid.<br /><br />For <span style="font-weight: bold">RPG &amp; Adventure music</span>, you won't want to miss out on the Kingdom of Light Series. Ranging from battle music, tavern music, mystical music, Victory &amp; Death cues, scenic landscape music and much more, this is perhaps the first of it's kind that brings together an all-in-one music solution for high-quality adventure fantasy games. The list price is already an incredible bargain, but throughout this rest of this month it's absurdly low. For those wanting just tavern music, or battle music, etc.. the Kingdom of Light is also broken down into modules to serve specific needs. The Premium edition is the best bargain which includes all cues, 192 minutes.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Horror or suspense music</span> needed? Check out 'Haunted Nature' and 'Symphony of Suspense' for stingers, swells and loops! Created for motion picture, these will add that extra professional audio touch to your games.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">8-bit / sidescroller music</span>? Make your gamers smile with 'cues from 'Happy Music'!<br /><br />..and don't forget <span style="font-weight: bold">UI sounds</span>!!! - Audio Touch.<br /><br />If you like what you hear, but need <span style="font-weight: bold">custom music</span>. Shoot me an email and we can discuss what your needs are and work on a solution. I'll be more then happy to work with you to bring your game up to the next level through the great sounding soundtrack. Thanks guys and have a great rest of the wk!<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Peter<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">http://www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">Happy Holidays everyone!<br /><br />For the holidays I've dropped the prices on several items so grab them while you can! Up to 60% off. Here's a few things to check out depending on the genre of your game.<br /><br />RPG/Fantasy/Medeival (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bonixmusic.com/kingdom-of-light">http://bonixmusic.com/kingdom-of-light</a><!-- m -->) The Kingdom of Light series brings everything to the table from Tavern band, Battle, Dungeons, City, Time of Day,  Mystical cues and much more. Modules can be purchased or Editions for a ridiculously low price per song (Approx $1 per song for the Premium edition). Don't let the low price fool you in terms of quality. These are orchestra cues for those that demand a professional quality score that's cohesive throughout. So instead of sounding like random songs put together, this was produced over the course of months for all music to be coherent much like what you would hear in a film score. The best bargains from the KoL is the Premium Edition(includes ALL modules) and the Town &amp; Taverns(includes Taverns, Cities, &amp; village Modules). The most popular is the Premium Edition and Cave &amp; Dungeons.<br /><br />Sci-Fi. Lots options here. The Atsmospheric Sound Design series focuses on sci-fi cues ranging from ambient, ship sounds, to more exotic sfx(mech, missles, alarms, rooms, etc). Best bargain here is Titan as it includes 3 full libraries plus 6 new songs. For those on an extremely low budget or just need a handful of killer tracks, check out the various ASD libraries.<br /><br />Fantasy: (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bonixmusic.com/cinematic-fantasy">http://bonixmusic.com/cinematic-fantasy</a><!-- m -->) Cinematic Fantasy Master Collection is one of my personal favorites library for fantasy. With strong cinematic style arranging and orchestration, this music has a slight inquisitive quality with the robust power of a full orchestra. This music has a lot of charm and character.<br /><br />Lots of other music to check out at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bonixmusic.com/products">http://bonixmusic.com/products</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />Custom Music: My team can help create custom music for your next game or other rmultimedia project. Please contact me through my contact page with what you're needing and I'll get back to you to see what we can do for you.  <br /><br />Thanks guys and everyone have a great and safe holiday and rest of the year!<br /><br />Peter<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.BonixMusic.com">www.BonixMusic.com</a><!-- w --><br /><br />Side note: I'll be keeping up the Free Zone for those who haven't had a chance to get some nice cues for free. A small gift for your time for visiting. Enjoy!</div>
