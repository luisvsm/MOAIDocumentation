Nice guide, desktop works fine for me and I've installed the USB drivers for my LG P705 and can see it in the 'adb devices' list. Running the build targeting that device appears to launch fine but all I get is a blank, black screen and no spinning MOAI logo. Looking at the 'adb logcat' I can't see any obvious errors that appear to do with MOAI or moai-nao.<br /><br />Can anybody offer me any other debugging tips?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Tue Jun 25, 2013 1:49 am</p><hr />

Great guide! I too have been trying several IDEs for developing MOAI with but with little luck. Sublime2 looks very promising, especially with deploying to Android being so quick and easy! Big thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold">bach</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">thebullno1</span>!<br /><br />Is there anyway to add debugging support? Or possibly autocomplete for MOAI api?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=852">dooms101</a> — Mon May 28, 2012 5:39 pm</p><hr />

Hi bach, great guide, thanks for posting it.<br /><br />Quick question, I got everything up and running on Win7, but I'm noticing that when I run through Moai, any print statements I do within my Lua code aren't shown until after the program exits.  Maybe this is an issue with using the default windows host?  do you know a way to get print statements to actively show up in Sublime Text console while it's running?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=903">Kyrra</a> — Thu May 24, 2012 4:01 pm</p><hr />

Glad it worked out in the end.

I'm not sure what you're downloading, or from where, but I'm not seeing it. I just re-downloaded the .zip file (android-sdk_r18-windows.zip), and its not there.<br /><br />Here's what I got, at the top level:<br /><br />- add-ons<br />- platforms<br />- tools<br />- AVD Manager.exe<br />- SDK Manager.exe<br />- SDK Readme.txt<br /><br />Under the tools folder, there's a .txt file, called adb_has_moved, with the message I included in my last post. I'm also not seeing a platform-tools folder.<br /><br />I'm not sure how you got the ADB executable with your download, but the readme explicitly states its not included in this .zip file:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />The Android SDK archive initially contains only the basic SDK tools. It does<br />not contain an Android platform or any third-party libraries. In fact, it<br />doesn't even have all the tools you need to develop an application.<br /><br />In order to start developing applications, you must install the Platform-tools<br />and at least one version of the Android platform, using the SDK Manager.<br /><br />Platform-tools contains build tools that are periodically updated to support new<br />features in the Android platform (which is why they are separate from basic<br />SDK tools), including adb, dexdump, and others.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />However, the readme also says that you can perform an update through the command line. After some fiddling, I think I got it to run through there. There were a few error messages at the beginning, but it seems to be downloading a bunch of files now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=288">derickdong</a> — Mon May 14, 2012 5:44 pm</p><hr />

I've also re-downloaded the file a couple times, to make sure I hadn't gotten a corrupted file.<br /><br />The window pops up when I try to run the Android SDK manager. I tried the Android AVD Manager as well, just for the hell of it, but I get the same response. I've run it both by double-clicking the .exe file in the folder, and through the Start menu, though it shouldn't make a difference.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>bach wrote:</cite><br />Try and manually do the steps in cmd line.

The ADB tool isn't downloaded until <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> you've run the SDK manager. There's a couple .txt files included that say as much:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />The adb tool has moved to platform-tools/<br /><br />If you don't see this directory in your SDK,<br />launch the SDK and AVD Manager (execute the android tool)<br />and install &quot;Android SDK Platform-tools&quot;<br /><br />Please also update your PATH environment variable to<br />include the platform-tools/ directory, so you can<br />execute adb from any location.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I tried running the SDK manager from a command prompt, but the program silently fails.<br /><br />I'll going to download Eclipse, and attempt to run it through the ADT plugin. I didn't want to have to do this, but I figure I may as well give it a shot.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=288">derickdong</a> — Mon May 14, 2012 4:41 pm</p><hr />

If you're certain the environment variable is correct, you may need to reboot. Windows often doesn't realize a change has been made until after you've rebooted.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I simply cannot get the Android SDK to work on my machine. I tried before this tutorial was available, and I tried again by following these steps. In both cases, I get the same results - when I run it, a console window quickly flashes, then disappears. Looking around the web, it seems this is a somewhat common problem, but none of the solutions I've found so far work.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Hey,<br /><br />can you tell me what you've done up to this point? Did you extract the sdk? What were you trying to do when the window popped up and disappeared again?<br /><br />Try and manually do the steps in cmd line. The one tool you need access to is ADB.
