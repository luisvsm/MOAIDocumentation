				<div class="content">Been on Corona SDK for the last 11 months and now looking at Moai.<br /><br />I have 3 apps on the iOS App Store (well 2 and 1 in review).<br /><br />Just wondering the best way to get started really, I have Moai installed and working fine on my MacBook. So want to jump in and start developing my first game/app with it.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering why am looking elsewhere -<br /><br />Firstly money (or lack of it) and not being able afford to renew my Corona license. Also I want to get my apps on Android, Kindle HD and Nook and with Corona you need to buy the professional license for that.<br /><br />Secondly Moai is open source and hopefully will get stuff developed for it by other teams. For instance I know a few guys over on Hacker News are discussing getting Ouya support working. Also am sure DoubleFine will find things they want to improve or add new stuff. This sort of thing is just not possible with Corona (unless they buy your company <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />).<br /><br />Dave</div>

				<div class="content">I would certainly recommend starting <a href="http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Moai-tutorial-series-The-adventures-of-an-intrepid-programmer-in-the-lands-of-Moai.aspx" class="postlink">with my tutorial series</a>, they contain pretty much all of the basics, so when you are done you will have most of what you need to get started.  Of course, I am a bit biased of course.<br /><br />The next step is to jump in to the C++ sources.  That honestly is the next best documentation point.</div>

I accidentally removed the RSS link on a site redesign.  You can still get the feed here ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamefromscratch.com/syndication.axd">http://www.gamefromscratch.com/syndication.axd</a><!-- m --> ).  Truth is, I actually find Twitter has usurped the role of RSS in many ways, so if you want to track the site, @gamefromscratch on twitter is probably the best way... if you are on twitter that is <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Oh, and the site is actually hosted on BlogEngine, but its based on a modified and translated WP theme.<br /><br />Glad you enjoyed the tutorial.</div>
