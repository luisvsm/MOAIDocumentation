@stun, Of course you can grab that branch and make what you want with it. The most challenging part left is rendering. <br />I was thinking of using liquidfun output to feed MOAIParticleSystem with init/render scripts. This will give tons of flexibility to play with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1427">Vavius</a> — Tue Aug 19, 2014 6:14 am</p><hr />

Yes I was considering trying out Vavius' branch and seeing what was left to do/missing. Seems a shame not to knock the thing off since we've moved to Box2D 2.3.0 and Vavius has done enough to show a reasonable demo.<br /><br />Is there any etiquette involved in doing so? I don't want to offend anybody by taking their work and extending it.<br /><br />I notice LiquidFun has moved on a bit too, up to version 1.1.0.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Mon Aug 18, 2014 8:42 pm</p><hr />

Hmmm, seems like we're duplicating effort now and you've moved ahead of me judging from your code. Yeah my debug draw implementation was the obvious naive one too. Ah well I'll leave you to it Vavius since I'm offline for 10 days. Hopefully you'll have finished it by the time I get back! If not perhaps we could collaborate on the effort to get all the LiquidFun features exposed in MOAI, since there's a fair bit there.<br /><br />How much more work before you're going to consider submitting to 1.5-development?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Mon Apr 14, 2014 7:52 pm</p><hr />

I started to put up bindings for LiquidFun. Small demo: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/AY2-qXYT6Lg">http://youtu.be/AY2-qXYT6Lg</a><!-- m --><br />It's just the beginning, much work to do. <br /><br />Some problems for discussion:<br />1) LiquidFun ParticleSystem and ParticleGroup have a lot values in Def struct, but they don't have setters/getters for these values. So the only option is to pass a key-value table from lua to object factory. This kinda different from current bindings<br />2) I think that MOAI converts too much things to units. For example, density. Reasonable value for UnitsToMeters is 0.05 (or 0.03 as it is close to box2d default). Therefore, reasonable value for density is 1 * 0.05^2 = 0.0025. I doubt that anyone using MOAI uses densities in the range [0.00025, 0.025]. But this is most stable values. Stability is crucial in fluid simulation. <br />3) Rendering. Particle debug drawing is done with Points. I suppose that circles will be too much overhead (with current naive debug draw implementation).

Heh thanks all. I'm a New Zealander so it's a short jaunt across the ditch to Melbourne for me and my family. Halfnelson, you don't happen to be going to PAX Melbourne this year at all do you? I plan to attend again. Maybe we could have a quiet beer then.<br /><br />Started working on MOAIBox2DParticleSystem last night and already seeing some interesting things. For example the MOAI model in Box2D generally seems to be to try and generate a 1:1 equivalency between say a 'b2' object (like b2Body) and a MOAIBox2D object (like MOAIBox2DBody). That's fine, but sort of falls down when it comes to particles.<br /><br />LiquidFun obviously deals with a LOT of particles. Thousands of them. It provides ways to address them individually from a 'b2ParticleSystem', but it would seem to be overkill to expose that to MOAI and have an equivalent MOAIBox2DParticle class. In particular I'm loathe to add another 'userData' pointer to the b2Particle class (which would be required for a simple b2Particle &lt;-&gt; MOAIBox2DParticle mapping) in LiquidFun because that'll consume a fair chunk of extra memory for a large set of particles.<br /><br />So it seems MOAIBox2DParticle might be the first casualty, and the equivalent functionality would be exposed through MOAIBox2DParticleSystem functions with indexes basically. I'll have to grub around in the MOAI codebase some more and see how they handle similar problems - in the existing MOAI particle system for example, a different beast but with similar problems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Thu Apr 10, 2014 4:38 am</p><hr />

Thanks ibisum, there's probably at least a couple of weeks of spare time coding to go. Unfortunately the timing is a bit bad as I'll be heading to Australia for 10 days, mid next week for my sister's wedding - don't think I'll be allowed to take my laptop <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />! I'm hoping I can at least get a first cut of basic functionality going before then which will just be in my own repo here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fivevolthigh/moai-dev">https://github.com/fivevolthigh/moai-dev</a><!-- m --> under the 'fvh-liquidfun' branch. It'll probably stay there for quite a while until I'm happy enough to submit a pull request.<br /><br />The particle system looks interesting, it has support for colour blending built in for example, and supports a 'particle life duration' (going to be interesting figuring out how to release props tied to particles that have been killed by LiquidFun) as well as a system for attempting to detect 'stuck particles' and giving the caller a way of dealing with them. It's a nice clean addition to Box2D as well which will hopefully make things easier.<br /><br />The LiquidFun Testbed includes a bunch of good examples of the system in work (and even a couple of simple games), so if you haven't done so already I'd recommend building it and having a play. Performs fine on my laptop of course, with plenty of particles. I'm very curious about how it'll perform on an Android phone though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Tue Apr 08, 2014 7:45 pm</p><hr />
