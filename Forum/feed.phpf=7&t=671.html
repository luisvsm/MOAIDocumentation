No problem.<br /><br />Your virtual currency doesn't need to radically change the game play. A lot of the items we sell in Wolf Toss are decorative, but everyone likes customizing their Wolf and buying fx trails etc. Even a small amount of revenue from virtual goods is likely to be better than banner ads. Also, our Tapjoy integration is currently targeted at the offer wall piece, not the banners.<br /><br />Another idea would be to do something like AdColony video ads at the beginning of a level, and give players the option to buy an unlock to remove the ads. We try not to do that where possible because it can be quite annoying.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=102">todd</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2012 10:10 pm</p><hr />

Thanks Todd, for that insightful answer! <img src="/forums/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />As you've probably guessed, I'm completely new to the mobile gaming industry, and so I've got a ton of stuff to learn about the business side of things. Unfortunately, I don't think my game is very well suited for virtual currency, but I'll see if I can come up with an idea of how to implement it. On the other hand, I've just realized that Tapjoy deliver ads as well. Even though the ads probably won't make me any serious money, I'll check it out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=437">joarb</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2012 7:51 pm</p><hr />

We have Tapjoy integrated into Moai, which is a great place to start. Does your game have a virtual currency in it?<br /><br />We've looked at a couple of others. For example, we are experimenting with AdColony in Wolf Toss for incentivized video from an interstitial. <br /><br />Mobile banner type ads aren't going to do anything for your revenue because the eCPM is low and users just don't click on them. You would need millions and millions of users to make any substantial revenue from traditional banner ads. Much better to build a freemium game and tie ads/offers to a virtual currency reward using Tapjoy or AdColony. <br /><br />Let me know any other questions.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=102">todd</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2012 6:16 pm</p><hr />

I'm wondering if anyone have had some experience with ad-based monetization companies. As far as I understand, Apsalar are great for analytics, but they don't provide ad distribution themselves? <br /><br />How do you decide what ad solution to go for? Is Google AdSense ok, or is it perhaps wiser to go for one of the mobile distribution companies like AdMob, Greystripe or AdFonic? Do you know of a great alternative to one of the before mentioned companies? What about SDKs? Is there one solution that is outstandingly easy to integrate? Would be awesome if anyone feel like sharing his/her experience with such treacherous waters ...
