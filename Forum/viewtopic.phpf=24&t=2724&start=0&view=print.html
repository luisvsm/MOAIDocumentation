				<div class="content">Hi, I'm trying to decide what analytics solution to use for my upcoming game - I'd like to track some pretty basic things, so I'd go for something as simple/cheap as possible. Any experience with AppSalar or any other solutions ?<br />Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">We use Flurry. Works good for basic things: user count, session length, audience info. It has support for custom events with parameters, but lacks any kind of querying mechanism. Sometimes we may want to know how many users buy more than one in-app or what was the last level that user played before he leaves the game for more than one week. <br />Flurry is completely free even for large loads of data.</div>

				<div class="content">To analyze or not to analyze that is the question <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I really want to know which ones of my levels stink.. and how many are playing the game. But I dont want to track people really it feels a bit evil. <br /><br />It seems to be standard practice for successful apps like candy crush to track every single click you do without even asking if thats ok</div>

Right now 100% of users are being tracked, but if a dialog popped the question I guess 50-90% would decline participation. So its a trick played on behalf of those users, in my book. Sorry for going off topic about this.. really tough decision for me to decide against analytics because it could improve the game.</div>

				<div class="content">Our experience with Amazon Analytics:<br /><br />- free game - ok<br />- paid game - you will get people leaving bad reviews about how they paid for a game that then invaded their privacy.<br /><br />There are a bunch of users who will NOT install/play an app if analytics are present - speak from experience.</div>

				<div class="content">How do they know analytics are present? <br /><br />Uh I didn't mean one should just track everything and not let the user know!<br />In my game I only track some anonymous data. score,times played, time, ip(incase of cheating with the leaderboards).</div>
