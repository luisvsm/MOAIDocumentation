				<div class="content">Something has been bothering me about the MOAI scene lately, and I've just now worked out what it is: where the hell are Zipline?  <br /><br />Are you guys just under the radar/in crunch mode/ignoring us?<br /><br />There have been many threads lately where I've thought &quot;surely, someone from Zipline is going to comment on this&quot; .. but nada.<br /><br />Also, this lack of attention to 'the scene' from Zipline manifests itself in other ways.  How many forks and patches and random branches of MOAI are out there - right now, it seems like *A LOT*.  Zipline, please, can you please do something to address the fracturing situation thats going on: get a much smoother flow going on merging pull requests from the community.  Lately it seems like a few people are branching because there is no way to get stuff merged into mainline (Linux support, Audio fixes, other bug fixes) and when it does occur, it happens in long intervals.  I think, with all the effort the community is putting into moving MOAI forward, Zipline needs to be paying a lot more attention on a daily/weekly basis, rather than monthly, right now.  We need to nurture this scene, guys ..</div>

				<div class="content">I hope Moai doesn't slowly fade away, it's such a great SDK. Sometimes I prefer it was a commercial product, so it could get more love from the developer team. The way it is now, I understand it's a gift to us from Zipline, and I am extreeemely grateful for that, but I am worried that all our time put into Moai might be in vain if the SDK gets discontinued (and looking at the forums or Github I can't help by thinking that it already looks discontinued).</div>

				<div class="content">I'm perfectly fine if the guys are supporting Double Fine and HBS, this means cash for Zipline for further development, and great new updates to the SDK. In the meantime, maybe we can organize to update the documentation ourselves, or at least wiki or samples. Though it would be great if Zipline could at least check in once a week to coordinate with us.</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, random question. To me, the biggest concern with Zipline's support for the open source side of MOAI is that we have to wait for these busy people to pull useful changes into the moai-dev github, because we don't own it. Patrick's reply is perfectly reasonable I thought. They're a company, making games for a living. The fact MOAI is open source is really a gracious move on their part, but not part of their business plan. I think we don't want to become a burden for them.<br /><br />Would it be worth combining the active community here into a moai-dev-community fork of moai-dev? A repo that the community could be responsible for that we can collectively contribute to, and that would be maintained/controlled by more active and experienced MOAI developers that are part of the community here (and are willing to give up some of their time to do so)? I'm not volunteering for that position as I don't have the experience with MOAI/OpenGL/gamedev to do that, but I would absolutely love to see a single community repo that I could fork from and contribute to, and that might be updated a little more frequently than the main moai-dev repo?</div>

				<div class="content">@stun:<br />I think it's great idea and totally makes sense. I've added a few useful things to Moai myself, although with my limited knowledge I'm not sure I've done it the right way. But would like to contribute if I knew how to --- I never used Git in my life. But definitely with our combined knowledge we can make the Moai development more dynamic using moai-dev-community fork. Great to start this discussion, maybe we should open a separate forum thread about this?</div>

				<div class="content">Its good that they've made it clear that they're not making money on MOAI SDK so therefore the support is what it is - this actually helps me calm down a bit, knowing the circumstances on the other side.  It feels like things sort of jam up on MOAI at times, and now its clear why that is: because the small team is doing what it has to do to survive in its main chosen business purpose, and MOAI SDK isn't a big part of that, financially anyway.  So, okay, this doesn't diminish MOAI SDK at all, but it does point out that if we want MOAI to have a future, then its as much up to us to sort out anything that might prevent that future from being prosperous, powerful, and .. fun!  <br /><br />I hope we can get some community repo maintainer to step forward, get permissions needed, and bring the community contribs into the main SDK for future releases.. this would help a great deal.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm probably maintaining the fork with the most complicated changed.  I have been keeping my fork up to date whenever Zipline makes any changes to the trunk.  I am still working with Moai and I would be willing to maintain a community branch.<br /><br />How should I go about doing this?  Should I create a community branch and then start merging into my fork?</div>

				<div class="content">Well maybe it'd be better to de-personalize the community branch, and get it in mainline as a branch?  Looking at the situation over the last few days, I realize that Zipline have their work branches and so on pretty much pushing the bleeding edge, and we in the community will/maybe are playing catchup.  Perhaps if we just got zipline to make a community branch, with a couple of maintainers from our midst, then we can start to push stuff to that branch, giving us a better chance of also integrating with the Zipline bleeding edge.<br /><br />Not sure, but definitely we ought to discuss this until we resolve it.  I want to push the MOAIKeyboardAndroid stuff as far forward as possible, as well as a few other bug-fixes too, but its kind of hard to participate in the Zipline party.</div>

Sort of thing ..<br /><br />But anyway the situation is not so dire that we need the support, just that as we struggle to catch up with the competence of Zipline on the MOAI codebase, it'd be nice if they were involved in that, alas .. we know the answer now, its an economic one and not much else.  I myself know how hard it can be to justify working on MOAI all day long, even though thats what I want to be doing .. and not getting paid for it.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I think the interim solution is for someone to merge everything into a repository that is separate from the main branch, but to let pull requests stand as is.  That way Zipline can focus on putting food on table now and worry about the non-paying developer community when they can afford to do so.<br /><br />If this seems like the way to go, I do not care who manages the community branch.  I will volunteer to the extent I am using Moai and there are not any other takers.</div>

				<div class="content">Honestly I am starting to think MOAI is a lost cause and will always be. I thought Ziplines would treat it as a commercial project as it was supporting their cloud services but they clearly are not or they would have a polished system with regular releases. Also they seem to be supporting Corona, and soon Unity so they are certainly no huge win for them getting MOAI polished and feature complete because they can always say &quot;do that yourself&quot; or &quot;use Corona or Unity if you want something more polished&quot;. <br /><br />I think it would be better to keep the same/similar API and start from scratch with some plans to monetize some portion of the engine maybe a 2D level editor or more polished hosts or on device remote debugging support. ZIpline said a number of times that they have games to ship or soon (which meant 6 months to never). Their will always be a new game to ship, a big company needing help or another engine to support their cloud services. I think it has been long enough to develop a good sense of how the project will move forward and I am getting tired of wait and see. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong I really like MOAI and want it to have a good future and that is why I am being critical in the hopes it will change but as the OP said there is clearly &quot;a lack of attention&quot; but I don't think it is anything new revalantion as I have been here for a while. I would like to say maybe soon, maybe next week, next month, next release but we need to open our eyes: Its not just a short term pattern this is the way it is going to be and I'm sorry to say that but I think it needs to be said.</div>

				<div class="content">Zipline needs to focus on what puts food on the table.  If you need immediate attention, I'm sure you can pay for support.  To the extent you are a non-paying customer you need to be patient and work with what has been implemented.<br /><br />I'm confident things will come around, but I'm not going to give any sort of timeline.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd like to lock/delete this thread, I think its been cleared up pretty well, and it actually makes a lot of sense.  Whereas the Corona devs are making a lot of their revenue from the SDK support side, Zipline guys are focusing on titles, and I have sort of formed the opinion now that MOAI is a wonderful gift from guys working hard in a big factory.  I say I'd like to delete the thread, because I've changed my mind, they don't need to pay attention; we in the community need to, so we can help/assist/participate in the MOAI future.  To the extent that we get Ziplines' involvement, is probably going to be warranted due to our active contributions in covering the warts and holes in what is, actually, a damned fine set of tools.</div>
