Hi stun,<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />I actually saw your code for the XBox controller, a stub of it anyways, not complete...and I used an action the same way you did...the code I ended up with is different though.<br /><br />I didn't put it through the input manager (I was lazy I suppose)<br /><br />I can post my code if people are interested; let me know (and actually let me know where to post it too as this is likely not the best place <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1640">poorwillgames</a> — Thu Apr 03, 2014 1:37 am</p><hr />

Good luck! I integrated XInput into MOAI a while ago, although I don't think I did it correctly (and now I can't find my code dammit). I'd be nice if we could actually get XBox Controller support into the Windows host properly, because it's certainly a handy feature to have on Windows.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1009">stun</a> — Thu Apr 03, 2014 1:28 am</p><hr />

Thanks JDance!<br /><br />I would love to go with a demo-type offering, I'm not sure how to do that.  I see people with &quot;lite&quot; versions, but I've got something story based.  I guess I could go with the beginning of the story as the &quot;lite&quot; version.  Not sure if people are doing that.<br /><br />In semi-related news we just got a review from 148apps today, so I'm super-happy: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/500-years-act-1-review/">http://www.148apps.com/reviews/500-years-act-1-review/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Right now I'm trying to build on some work from the community here and put xbox 360 controller support into my windows host (using glut).  Then I'll likely rework the trailer and go for a steam greenlight, try to learn about how the PC world of gaming works.<br /><br />fun stuff! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1640">poorwillgames</a> — Tue Mar 25, 2014 2:36 am</p><hr />

Hey thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />I would and will go for some kind of free to try approach. Maybe not free-to-play because that's boring, but some kind of demo so that people get a chance to see what you have to offer. I have yet to try your game so I'm not sure what a good way to do it would be. But I'm installing it now so I'll try it and see <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1128">JDance</a> — Mon Mar 24, 2014 1:44 pm</p><hr />

Cool, thank you.<br /><br />For video software, thanks for the advice...I was only really aware of cinelerra in the open source world and didn't want to deal with the learning curve.<br /><br />Now, why did I wait to come to the forum...that's a bigger question.  I did check them out on occasion and had trouble finding answers to the problems I was looking for; but that's fine really...I could have asked and I'm sure I would have received suggestions right away.  There is a really good community here from everything I've seen.<br /><br />Not sure, I'm going on 15 years in software engineering and this is likely the first time I've ever used a forum.  I'm thinking it's a personality thing like not asking for directions <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Regarding Unity...yes unfortunately I did decide to go with it on my next game.....sorry...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1640">poorwillgames</a> — Thu Mar 13, 2014 6:40 pm</p><hr />

Congrats on finishing!  Will give your game a shot.<br /><br />For video editors I really like OpenShot and Pitivi, both opensource, free, and really easy to use.<br /><br />How come you waited until your project was done to come to these forums?  Might've found help with your issues before.

Thank's for the feedback JDance.<br /><br />I set the price to tier 4, which should be $3.99, and that's what it shows up as in the store.  I have no idea why it's saying $5 on the website for itunes.  It's a little crazy-making <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />That said, I'm tending to agree with you that it's a little over priced so I dropped it to tier 3 this morning.  I don't think I'll go any lower than that though, I'll have to take my chances really and hope.  Marketing has been less-than-good.  Just have to see what happens and pick up the pieces where they fall.<br /><br />I did put a video together but it's not good.  I don't have a device with an hdmi out, and recording from the screen really sucks.  Basically I didn't make the investment, if I pay for that I'll put it in the lessons learned bucket for next time.<br /><br />The game I'm currently working on isn't a mobile target, it's PC first, mobile second.  I'll have to see how that goes too when it's time. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks again!<br />....Jonas<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1640">poorwillgames</a> — Thu Mar 13, 2014 1:28 pm</p><hr />

Hey seems cool! I'll probably buy it to try. But I wonder about your price, you must do some great marketing to charge that much. We're gonna try a free to play 2 chapter out of 5 - then pay to unlock the whole game approach. Just to get people to play the game. And we're probably gonna charge like 1$ for the unlock sadly <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm new to the business but it seems players on mobile simply don't want to pay unless it's Minecraft or something.<br /><br />Do you have a video of the game? It would help to get me to shell out $5. Yes as a mobile user I am that cheap <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://192.168.20.226:3000/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1128">JDance</a> — Thu Mar 13, 2014 7:35 am</p><hr />
