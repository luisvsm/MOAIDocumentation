				<div class="content">Unzipping "moai-moai-beta-Version-0.8-Beta-Revision-8-0-g401389d.zip" on Windows Vista gave this error:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"Error 0x80010135: Path too long"
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />For these 3 files:
<br />
<br />
<br />TJ Virtual Goods-own-target-headers.hmap
<br />
<br />TJ Virtual Goods-all-target-headers.hmap
<br />
<br />TJ Virtual Goods.LinkFileList
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Without further investigation, I am assuming these files are for Macintosh, and thus the error.
<br />
<br />I was unsuccessful in finding this feedback in the forums or wiki, which is why I am posting.</div>

				<div class="content">You are correct. Those are part of the Tapjoy SDK and only used by iOS. Wasn't aware they were breaking unzip on Windows. Will see what we can do.
<br />
<br />But for that, did the rest of the unzip work for you? Or are you blocked?</div>

<br />
<br />The <strong>VS2008 Solution</strong> is building <strong>Debug </strong>OK (except for <em>"RtAudio.cpp(3521) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'dsound.h': No such file or directory"</em>, which I am currently assuming is a DirectX path issue).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />A note that I too used the Windows built-in Zip utility, in Windows Vista (.e. "Extract All…"), to get the "Path too long" errors.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, sounds like a DirectX path issue. Did you find the readme about adding the DirectX paths to Visual Studio? (Decided to do it that way instead of in the project itself since people may have DirectX installed in different places...)</div>

				<div class="content">I want to share with all those who are victim of such long path files<br />Long path files are those files which have a path having charcters more than the limit allowed by windows,ie approx 200<br />Whenever we want to change,delete,move,cut,omit,share or install such file windows give error like file is copy write protected,it is used by some other application or user,is blocked etc<br />First way is to change file name but it dont work<br />Second way is to delete such file by holding shift but it also dont work<br />Third way is to use a tool which embeds into core and resolves such long path,there are many tools available both freeware and shareware,here are some with their destination websites:<br />1.First of all is robocopy which is a tool given by microsoft for copying and xcopying files using command line interface,this robust tool boostes copy procedure but is leaste effective for long path files,i will rate it 1 star<br />2.Second one is pathlongtool available at pathlong.com,it is rated 2 star because it has limited functionality in case of mapping and changing such files<br />3.Third one is Long path support Api,this is a complex tool for advanced users having complex accessibilities,i will rate it as 2 star,it is avilable at file32.com<br />4.Fourth tool is bitchip file gear,it is a file copy gearer which cannot map and delete long path files but is extremely useful in gearing copying of such files,rated as 3 star.It is available at file32.com<br />5.The most effective and efficient is longpathtool availabe at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.longpathtool.com">http://www.longpathtool.com</a><!-- m --> ,it is a small,smart and quick to use software which can be easily downloaded from its site,it has optimum functionality and it can change,search,map from network,omit,copy,install and delete such long path file effectively being rated as 5 star</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Guys, just to update you, finally I found a way to solve it<br />Do you have error messages?, like :<br /><br />* Path too long<br />* Error cannot delete file: cannot read from source file or disk<br />* Cannot delete file: Access is denied<br />* There has been a sharing violation.<br />* Cannot delete file or folder The file name you specified is not valid or too long. Specify a different file name.<br /><br />For that I tried it with: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://longpathtool.com/">http://longpathtool.com/</a><!-- m --></div>
