# MOAIDocumentation
It's a lot harder to get MOAI SDK documentation now that getmoai. com and moaiforge. com are offline.

This repo includes ready to go documentation from all of the sources that I can find in 2024.
- The static site output of Moai Forge's community docs: https://github.com/moaiforge/community-docs
- The latest API docs from Moai Forge: https://github.com/moaiforge/api-docs
- The getmoai. com forums from Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20180703131047/http://getmoai.com:80/forums/

I hope this helps on your journey if you're still shipping something in MOAI.
